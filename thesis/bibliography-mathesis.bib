	abstract = {Supervised machine learning methods to model word sense often rely on human labelers to provide a single, ground truth label for each word in its context. We examine issues in establishing ground truth word sense labels using a fine-grained sense inventory from {WordNet}. Our data consist of a sentence corpus of 1,000 sentences: 100 for each of ten moderately polysemous words. Each word was given multiple sense labels-or a multilabel-from trained and untrained annotators. The multilabels give a nuanced representation of the degree of agreement on instances. A suite of assessment metrics is used to analyze the sets of multilabels, such as comparisons of sense distributions across annotators. Our assessment indicates that the general annotation procedure is reliable, but that words differ regarding how reliably annotators can assign {WordNet} sense labels, independent of the number of senses. We also investigate the performance of an unsupervised machine learning method to infer ground truth labels from various combinations of labels from the trained and untrained annotators. We find tentative support for the hypothesis that performance depends on the quality of the set of multilabels, independent of the number of labelers or their training.},

We maintain that Technology Transfer Offices at the universities are important tools for the researchers, and two concrete business models are discussed in some detail. We conclude that the most realistic commercialization strategy for an academic Scandinavian {MT} prototype is through creation of a new language technology company, alternatively allowing an existing software company the use of the prototype more or less for free. Even though two Norwegian prototypes are used as examples in this paper, we believe that the reflections are valid for other Scandinavian countries as well. 1},

designed for the visually impaired people to help them read the news, newspapers,
magazines and books and listen to audio books over the internet. The
audio system enhances access of the visually impaired to necessary information.
Simplicity of use enables them, through the internet, to benefit from various electronic
texts and the sound library, even if they do not have a daily experience of
computer use. in order to select appropriate speech rates perception tests were
carried out for the blind and the sighted. The speech rate perception tests did not
provide unequivocal answers to all questions posed. although the speech rate preferences
of the blind and the sighted displayed certain differences, the size of the
difference does not seem to depend so much on the visual impairment than on the
subject's experience of using the computer and screen reader. The ability to understand
high rate speech may develop after the fifth year of daily use of the computer
and of listening to synthesized speech. among our test group of visually
impaired people such a capacity was manifested in every fifth blind person.
although we did not manage to establish the optimum speech rate suitable for all
who took the perception test, we applied, besides the regular rate, two higher
speech rates in the audio system: a high rate (30\% higher than normal) and a very
high rate that was 60\% higher than the normal rate.},

	title = {Lexical Networks in Action},
	abstract = {Description

It is a fundamental tenet in usage-based approaches that the mental lexicon is structured, specifically lexical items are assumed to be connected and this kind of connectivity bears consequences for both processing, formation of linguistic categories and perception. This course offers an introduction to recent advances in techniques to explore the connectivity of lexical items in the mental lexicon using graph theory and statistical models. The utilization of graph theory offers several measures to quantify the potential connectivity in the mental lexicon. Recently, a number of studies have emerged that offer converging evidence for their cognitive plausibility.

Purpose and objective

The purpose of this course is to introduce lexical network models and demonstrate their application in empirical studies across different modalities. The empirical case studies cover the following topics: 1) semantics: modulation of semantic densities, i.e. number of senses, of English monomorphemic verbs, and 2) morphology: processing of paradigmatic leveling of English irregular verbs. The following methods are employed in the case studies: corpus-based study, lexical decision and naming latencies, and eye-tracking. The data are modeled using state of the art methods: Linear Mixed-Effects and Generalized Additive Models. The objective of the course is to offer the students the theoretical and practical basis for utilizing lexical network models in different linguistic research settings.

First meeting:

Introduction to lexical networks

Quantification of lexical networks through graph theory

Application to modeling semantic densities of English monomorphemic verbs

 Second meeting:

Introduction to lexical decision and naming tasks

Paradigmatic structure and morphological leveling of English irregular verbs

Modeling the paradigmatic leveling of English irregular verbs using eye-tracking},

	abstract = {Want to tap the power behind search rankings, product recommendations, social bookmarking, and online matchmaking? This fascinating book demonstrates how you can build Web 2.0 applications to mine the enormous amount of data created by people on the Internet. With the sophisticated algorithms in this book, you can write smart programs to access interesting datasets from other web sites, collect data from users of your own applications, and analyze and understand the data once you've found it.Programming Collective Intelligence takes you into the world of machine learning and statistics, and explains how to draw conclusions about user experience, marketing, personal tastes, and human behavior in general -- all from information that you and others collect every day. Each algorithm is described clearly and concisely with code that can immediately be used on your web site, blog, Wiki, or specialized application. This book explains:   Collaborative filtering techniques that enable online retailers to recommend products or media Methods of clustering to detect groups of similar items in a large dataset Search engine features -- crawlers, indexers, query engines, and the {PageRank} algorithm Optimization algorithms that search millions of possible solutions to a problem and choose the best one Bayesian filtering, used in spam filters for classifying documents based on word types and other features Using decision trees not only to make predictions, but to model the way decisions are made Predicting numerical values rather than classifications to build price models Support vector machines to match people in online dating sites Non-negative matrix factorization to find the independent features in a dataset Evolving intelligence for problem solving -- how a computer develops its skill by improving its own code the more it plays a game Each chapter includes exercises for extending the algorithms to make them more powerful. Go beyond simple database-backed applications and put the wealth of Internet data to work for you. "Bravo! I cannot think of a better way for a developer to first learn these algorithms and methods, nor can I think of a better way for me (an old {AI} dog) to reinvigorate my knowledge of the details."-- Dan Russell, Google "Toby's book does a great job of breaking down the complex subject matter of machine-learning algorithms into practical, easy-to-understand examples that can be directly applied to analysis of social interaction across the Web today.

Do the equivalents in the Target Language cover all the aspects of the terms they are said to be equivalent to in the Source Language? Is there total meaning in translation? The aim of this article is to analyze some terms mainly taken from English, French, Setswana, Silozi, and Tonga to see whether or not total meaning and equivalence exist in translation. According to Hervey and Haggins (2002:18 - 19), descriptively speaking, « 'equivalence' denotes an observed relationship between {ST} utterances and {TT} utterances that are seen as directly corresponding to one another… Prescriptively, 'equivalence' denotes the relationship between an {SL} expression and the standard {TL} rendering of it, for example as given in a dictionary, or as required by a teacher, or as consonant with a given theory or methodology of translation. One wonders whether or not total meaning and equivalence exist in translation. This article is aimed at examining equivalence at some of these levels and ascertaining whether or not the equivalent in the target language covers all the aspects of the corresponding term in the source language, especially between languages that are not of the same linguistic family.

We put them to use in sub-sentential alignment, which constitutes the first step of most data-driven machine translation systems (statistical or example-based machine translation). We show that rare words can be used as a foundation in the design of a multilingual sub-sentential alignment method, using differential techniques similar to those found in example-based machine translation. This method is truly multilingual, in that it allows the simultaneous processing of any number of languages. Moreover, it is very simple, anytime, and scales up naturally. We compare our implementation, Anymalign, with two statistical tools proven in the domain. Although its current results are on average slightly behind those of state of the art methods in phrase-based statistical machine translation, we show that the intrinsic quality of our lexicons is actually superior to that of lexicons produced by state of the art methods.},

Indeed, aligned monolingual corpora are likely to boost the learning process of text-to-text generation models. A Paraphrase learning strategy can be defined as a two-step process: (1) identifying and extracting related sentence pairs from on-line comparable corpora (for example sentences that convey the same information but yet are written in different forms) and (2) applying learning methodologies over the extracted material to induce text-to-text rewriting rules. In this paper, we compare different lexical distance metrics for the identification of related sentences, i.e. paraphrase candidates. In particular, we discuss how different metrics lead to the identification of different types of paraphrases. Finally, the comparisons and discussions give relevant insights towards automatic generation of paraphrase corpora. 1},

        Abstract:
	  This article explores the architecture of the interface between morphosyntax and lexical semantics, in particular the semantic underpinnings of argument realization. Many theories of lexical meaning assume that argument realization is derived from underlying event structure: the relative prominence of coarguments in a clause follows from their relative semantic prominence in how the event unfolds. I show that event structure is not sufficient to capture certain generalizations about argument realization, however, focusing on arguments that alternate between direct and oblique realization. I show that for these alternations the relevant semantic contrast is in strength of truth conditions: direct realization encodes a monotonically stronger set of truth conditions associated with the alternating argument than oblique realization. This, I suggest, follows if word meanings are built from basic units that are related to one another implicationally, and the relative implicational strength of such components figures into argument realization. I use as a case study English locative and conative alternations, which, I argue, reflect stronger and weaker degrees of affectedness along an independently motivated affectedness hierarchy. I also show that similar contrasts are found with other alternations on other hierarchies. I conclude by suggesting that a theory of weakening truth conditions is not incompatible with event-structural analyses of verb meaning, and in fact the two augment one another.},

	abstract = {Lexicon acquisition from machine-readable dictionaries and corpora is currently a dynamic field of research, yet it is often not clear how lexical information so acquired can be used, or how it relates to structured meaning representations. In this paper I look at this issue in relation to Information Extraction (hereafter {IE}), and one subtask for which both lexical and general knowledge are required, Word Sense Disambiguation ({WSD}). The analysis is based on the widely-used, but little-discussed distinction between an {IE} system's foreground lexicon, containing the domain's key terms which map onto the database fields of the output formalism, and the background lexicon, containing the remainder of the vocabulary. For the foreground lexicon, human lexicography is required. For the background lexicon, automatic acquisition is appropriate. For the foreground lexicon, {WSD} will occur as a by-product of finding a coherent semantic interpretation of the input. {WSD} techniques as discussed in recent literature are suited only to the background lexicon. Once the foreground/background distinction is developed, there is a match between what is possible, given the state of the art in {WSD}, and what is required, for high-quality {IE}.},

Do the type and all its tokens share the same properties? Mustall the tokens be alike in some or all respects? §7 explains someproblems for the view that types exist, and some problems for the viewthat they don't. §8 elucidates a distinction often confused withthe type-token distinction, that between a type (or token) and anoccurrence of it.

Using a downloadable programming environment developed by the author, Visualizing Data demonstrates methods for representing data accurately on the Web and elsewhere, complete with user interaction, animation, and more. How do the 3.1 billion A, C, G and T letters of the human genome compare to those of a chimp or a mouse? What do the paths that millions of visitors take through a web site look like? With Visualizing Data, you learn how to answer complex questions like these with thoroughly interactive displays. We're not talking about cookie-cutter charts and graphs. This book teaches you how to design entire interfaces around large, complex data sets with the help of a powerful new design and prototyping tool called "Processing". Used by many researchers and companies to convey specific data in a clear and understandable manner, the Processing beta is available free. With this tool and Visualizing Data as a guide, you'll learn basic visualization principles, how to choose the right kind of display for your purposes, and how to provide interactive features that will bring users to your site over and over. This book teaches you:   The seven stages of visualizing data -- acquire, parse, filter, mine, represent, refine, and interact How all data problems begin with a question and end with a narrative construct that provides a clear answer without extraneous details Several example projects with the code to make them work Positive and negative points of each representation discussed. The focus is on customization so that each one best suits what you want to convey about your data set The book does not provide ready-made "visualizations" that can be plugged into any data set. Instead, with chapters divided by types of data rather than types of display, you'll learn how each visualization conveys the unique properties of the data it represents -- why the data was collected, what's interesting about it, and what stories it can tell. Visualizing Data teaches you how to answer questions, not simply display information.},

Co-occurrence is a precondition for the possibility that two tokens might be mutual translations. Models of co-occurrence are the glue that binds methods for mapping bitext correspondence with methods for estimating translation models into an integrated system for exploiting parallel texts. Different models of co-occurrence are possible, depending on the kind of bitext map that is available, the language-specific information that is available, and the assumptions made about the nature of translational equivalence. Although most statistical translation models are based on models of co-occurrence, modeling co-occurrence correctly is more difficult than it may at first appear.},

This paper shows that the alignment of Finnish (word) stress, which is fixed and associated with the initial syllable, is similarly realized over two morae. It is shown that segments and syllables have a reliably longer duration when they occur within the domain of the word's first two morae than when they occur outside this domain. The most conspicuous concomitant of primary stress is the durational variation of the second-syllable single vowel: if this vowel constitutes the word's second mora, its duration is very much longer than otherwise. Secondary stress is shown to involve a similar although attenuated durational variation in the second-syllable vowel of the word's second foot. It is further shown that when a consonant constitutes the word's second mora, the consonant is lengthened, but only if it is voiced. It is argued that the motivation for the second-mora lengthening (applying as it does to vowels and voiced consonants) is to provide room for the phonetic realization of accentuation.},

	abstract = {This article aims to give an overview of literary instruction in schools of the russification era at the beginning of the 20th century in Estonia; this was likewise the curriculum of literary study offered to the generation of educated youth which included the Young Estonians. Based on official documents, archival materials, and memoirs, and through analyses of anthologies, literary histories, and teaching methods in use at the time, we attempt to reconstruct the outlines of literary reading and requirements for students in various types of schools. When, as a result of school reform, Russian became the language of instruction; lessons in Russian became central in the curriculum, alongside the word of God; selections from Russian literature were read in the original language. In the lower grades, teaching was by the so-called ”natural method”, intended to guarantee swift achievement of fluency in ”living Russian language”; this was later replaced by systematic textual analysis, which distinguished between belles lettres and other types of texts. However, the study of literature was always subordinated to the goals of language instruction. In institutions of secondary education, study of Russian literature was separate from language instruction. Indeed, Russian literature was the only literature systematically studied in high schools (though one must keep in mind that not all schools completely followed the official program.) Private schools were especially noticeable for their greater freedom, though all of them had to take general curriculum directives into account. Reading of literary texts connected with other languages thus had to remain almost purely illustrative. In view of the above, in the upper grades of elementary school and high school, students obtained a thorough introduction to the Russian classics. According to the official school curriculum, Russian literary history ended with Nikolai Gogol. Attempts were made to ignore more modern authors altogether (to the point of banning them – this applied especially to the works of Fjodor Dostojevski). However, a good command of Russian made it possible to read those works not approved by the school, and to keep abreast of more recent Russian literature. Young Estonians took conspicuous interest in turn-of-the-century Russian literary life. Over time the split between ”anthologized” and real Russian literature continued to deepen, as did the conflict between the works and their official interpretations in schoolbooks. This tendency coincided with processes of renewal in Estonian literature. In the interim, knowledge of classical Russian literature acquired in school remained at the level of passive coexistence in the culture, a kind of backdrop to newer undertakings. Thus it is interesting to note that articles on Aleksandr Pushkin published in the 1920s Estonian press were addressed to the reader assumed to be knowledgeable both about his works and his biography. Reminiscences of school in the memoirs of several Estonian authors serve as evidence that learning about Russian literature, particularly poetry, was perhaps their only bright memory of school in the russification era.},

	abstract = {In Estonian culture, the past has value, and efforts are continuously being made to commit to memory that which is considered worth remembering. While there exist a number of histories (national history, literary history, art history, etc.), so far no comprehensive and systematic translation history has been written on Estonian culture. At the same time it cannot be said that there is lack of intere st in translation histor y: on the contrar y, many studies have been and are being made in relation to this topic. To use the terminology employed by Aleida Assmann to explain the areas and operation of cultural memory, the recent developments in the attitudes towards translation history in Estonia seem to show that translation history is something that should be remembered and brought out of the archives, transferred from states of passive remembrance and passive forgetting to the sphere of active remembrance.In comparison with many other areas, the idea that a history of translation is something desirable and necessary for a culture is a relatively recent phenomenon; in any case, younger than the idea of the indispensability of literary history, for example. One of the reasons for this may lie in the way translation has been perceived in Western culture and what its relation to ‘original’ literature has been. Susan Bassnett has estimated that the boundary between originals and translations began to be drawn in the seventeenth century, when the idea of an ‘original’ began to acquire currency, and that by the nineteenth century, the status of a translation was generally considered to be lower than that of an ‘original’. This kind of distinction between originals and translations has been noticeable in Estonian culture also, especially since the formation of the influential group “Young Estonia” at the beginning of the 20th century. Additionally, in Estonia as well as in many other countries, literature has been instrumental in shaping the identity of the nation and the concept of national culture. This has lead to a situation in which most translation histories composed to date have focused on the history of literary translation from the viewpoint, to a large extent, of national literary and cultural history.On the other hand, for some time already there have been calls to reconsider the national model of literary history, which has been premised on ethnic and often linguistic singularity. While Estonian traditional histories, such as linguistic, national, etc. have indeed often emphasised the quality of national selfhood, the history of cultural life in the territory of present day Estonia may also well be regarded from the perspective of linguistic and cultural heterogeneity. Several disciplines (for example linguistics, literary studies, and history) have already been paying at tention to this aspect for some time now, focusing on the multilinguistic and -cultural facets of the history of the Estonian territory and are thus approaching a pos sible intere st sphere of translation histor y. From the per spective of cultural memor y,another field that is important but that has, for the most part, escaped the attention of traditional histories of literature and translation is the intersemiotic transfers and transmedial relations between various media, between literature and other arts. Translation history could be a potentially comprehensive framework for the conceptualisation of various types of cultural contacts and transfers in the multilingual and multicultural history of Estonia. This means that translation history need not be modelled after traditional national or literary histories but that translation history itself could be regarded as a more general model that allows the integration of the national and the transnational, the belles lettres and the wider sphere of literature, elements of verbal and non-verbal culture, the principle of ethnic and discursive singularity and that of heterogeneity. It may be that what we end up with is not so much a history of translation as a history of culture, with translation as a connecting thread that runs through various topics and historical periods.},

Lingvistikaprofessor Daniel Everett üritas 30 aasta vältel neist inimestest aru saada. Ta väidab, et neil ei ole ühtegi sõna, et väljendada värve ja numbreid. Samuti pole neil mingeid jälgi oma esivanematest: ei pärimust, kunstiteoseid ega mälestusi. Everetti arvates hoidusid nad minevikust ja tulevikust, eelistades nautida igat päeva just nii, nagu see on. Nad on järjepidevalt tagasi lükanud kõik välismõjud ning paistavad olevat läbinisti õnnelikud.
“Õnne keel” põimib loo Everetti tagasiminekust pirahãde juurde tema enda teekonnaga alates 1960ndatest – narkosõltuvuses muusikust evangeelse misjonäri ja demagoogilise akadeemikuni.

	abstract = {The article presents statistical data on the publications of belles-lettres in Estonia in 1900–1940 – a period when the country developed into a modern European society and gained independence. The topic is treated in the context of book history, which uses publishing statistics to provide a broader context for individual case studies. The research on the quantity and share of translated literature in book production comes close to the statisticalsociological approach in translation history, characterised by Peeter Torop as one of the aspects of the study of translation culture. The statistical indicators have been elaborated on the basis of retrospective bibliographies and on the data, obtained from National Library of Estonia. The analysis includes the share of belles-lettres in book production, the balance of original works and translations, the changes in the quantity of translations during different decades and the share of source literatures. The Estonian statistics have been presented in comparison with corresponding data from Finland, which has been published in the collective monograph on Finnish translation history, issued in 2007. As the Finnish data is organized by decades, the same principle is used for statistics on Estonia. This approach corresponds generally to the political history of the two countries – both belonged to the Russian Empire during the first two decades of the 20th century and existed as independent states during the following two decades. Both nations had passed through the first stage in the development of literary culture, characterised by extensive publication of adaptations and free translations by the beginning of the century. Thus the share of original works started to increase and slightly exceeded the share  of  translations  in  E stonia  as  well  as  in  Finland.  The  selection  of  translated  works  in both countries was varied and their level was unstable. Despite the longstanding plans of developing translation culture in Finland, the choice of works was influenced by international acclaime and the activitiy of translators. The immaturity of Estonian publishing manifested itself, among other things, as inadeaquate paratexts of the translations. Due to the differences in historical development and cultural background, the structure of  source  literature s  of  translated  belle s-let tre s  in  the  two  countrie s  dif fered  in  many  ways – translating from the English language increased considerably in Finland, fending the traditional German and Scandinavian domination. The importance of translations of German literature, which maintained the leading role in Estonia, is a common feature of both countries. At the same time, the interest in Scandinavian literature only started to emerge in Estonia. The  translations  of  Rus sian  literature,  however,  were  much  more  numerous  in  E stonia  thanin Finland. In general, the period of 1900–1919 is characterised by a notable increase in the quantit y of translated belles-lettres as well as their uneveness. However, the growing number of translations provided greater diversity, introducing new authors, styles and trends.The existence of an independent Republic of Estonia (since 1918) opened utterly new perspectives for the development of national culture – for the first time it could be done without external control and using the Estonian language in all levels of administration and education. These circumstances fostered publishing, the demand for books was especially great during the first years after the War of Independence (1918–1920), later the declines and increases in book production were connected to the economic conditions. Belles-lettres formed about 20 per cent of the title production, which in turn was almost equally divided between original works and translations. In contrast to Estonia, the number of translations started to decrease in Finland in the 1930s due to economic and political factors, idealising conservative national values. The hierarchy of source languages underwent a major change in Estonia where the English language ascended to the leading position, exceeding the translations from German and French. The importance of translations from Russian language remained a characteristic feature of Estonian publishing, unknown in Finland during the 1920s-1930s. Estonians were also active in translating Finnish literature. The Estonian publishing houses issued ten times more translations from Finnish than vice versa – a disproportion explained with the lack of interest among the Finnish publishers. Although the output of  translations  included  a  wide  variet y  of  high-qualit y  works,  they  were  outnumbered  by genre fiction, preferred by the large audiences both in Estonia and in Finland. The Writer’s Unions of Estonia and Finland attempted to suppress their proliferation without success. However, on the whole, the corpus of translations issued in the 1920s and 1930s presents a rather balanced selection oriented to different strata of the audience.},

	volume = {7},
	issn = {1736-6852},

	doi = {10.7592/methis.v7i9/10.566},
	abstract = {The aim of the article is to compare two 17th century translations of the New Testament: the translation by Heinrich Stahl (1638) and the translation by Johannes Gutslaff (1641–1656). Relying on the model of description presented by Torop (1989) and Torop and Osimo (2010), the translations are described by three aspects (1) linguistic, (2) functional, (3) that of the translator`s position within three different time perspectives: achronic, synchronic and diachronic. Within the achronic perspective, the two translations seem to be quite different in all three aspects. In the case of Stahl´s translation, the original text was Luther´s German translation and the target language was the North-Estonian vernacular. Different parts of the Bible had probably been translated by different persons and Stahl collected them, publishing them in a volume of his church manual. Gutslaff, on the other hand, translated the text himself using the original Greek version. His target language was the South-Estonian vernacular but his work was never published. Within the diachronic perspective, the differences disappear and the two translations seem to be quite similar. From today`s point of view both tr anslations are linguistically archaic and have no functional value except as object s of scientific research. Synchronic description is the most complicated one. The article tries to put to the test the possibilities of describing old translations from the point of view of their translation method. Very few examples of the Estonian language of the 17th century have been preserved, most are translations from German written down by German pastors. In addition to that, researchers know almost nothing about the Estonian language spoken by native  speaker s of  the  time. As a  re sult of  this,  it  is hard  to  evaluate  the  linguistic  status of many constructions and idioms used by the translators. This in turn makes it difficult to evaluate the stylistic intentions of the translator and renders the whole synchronic description problematic.},

	abstract = {The current study explored the acoustic and perceptual effects of speaking rate adjustments in persons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ({ALS}) and in neurologically normal individuals. Sentence utterances were obtained from the participants at two self-selected speaking rates: habitual and fast. Total utterance durations, segment durations, and vowel formant frequencies comprised the acoustic measures, whereas magnitude estimates of speech intelligibility and severity of speech involvement were the perceptual measures. Results showed that participants in both the neurologically normal and {ALS} groups were able to increase their speaking rate when asked to do so, but that the participants with {ALS} were significantly slower than the neurologically normal participants at both rates. Both groups of participants also showed compression of the acoustic vowel space with increased speaking rate, with the vowel spaces of participants with {ALS} generally being more compressed than the vowel spaces of neurologically normal participants, at either rate. Most importantly, the perceptual measures failed to show any effect of the speaking rate adjustment on scaled intelligibility or severity, for either group. These findings are discussed relative to the general issue of slow habitual speaking rates among many speakers with dysarthria, and possible explanations for the slowness. The lack of an effect of increased rate on the perception of the speech deficit among speakers with {ALS} argues against the idea that the habitually slow rates are a form of compensation to reduce the complexity of speech production.},

	abstract = {The tradition of translating ancient Greek and Roman authors into Estonian is short, beginning with first attempts at the end of the 18 th century and the close adaptations of two Anacreontic poems (21 and 24) by the first Estonian poet Kristjan Jaak Peterson (in 1818), which remained in manuscript for a long time. The continuous history of printed translations began in 1878 with the translations from Homer by Jaan Bergmann. At present, a new, extensive and regularly updated bibliography with a database of earlier translations is being created ({EAB} 2012), which also includes the translations in the journals and more extensive citations in articles, as printing separate books with ancient literature started very late (1908) and was very rare in the beginning.  The periods in Estonian translation reflect the history of the country. Almost every period has its own specific trends, beginning with the focus on Greek and the role of periodicals in the first, resembling the patchwork-model of translation that has been described by Karl Eimermacher. Alongside the wish to entertain and educate, we see a strong tendency to use these translations for the development of Estonian national identity by comparing the Estonian epic “Kalevipoeg” to Homer’s epics and translating pieces from Tacitus’ “Germania” as early references to Estonia and thereby extending Estonia’s written history.  The 1920s and 1930s bring first attempts to create a canon, with a stress on Latin and the translations made for school, as well as the development of verse translation. However, all this was disrupted by the almost total abandonment of the classical tradition during the war and the Stalinist period. The comeback in the 1960s brought the translation of central authors from the classical canon (Homer, Vergil, Sophocles), supported by other activities of canon-building (anticipated partly in the 1920s and 1930s): the composition of anthologies and histories of literature. The expansion of canon through a broader choice of works (and studies of central authors and genres) as well as more translators has occurred since the 1990s, when classical philology was taught again at the university.  The general trends are toward increasing specialisation, the important role of periodicals and a marked tendency to achieve two goals: to educate and to entertain. Next to the patchwork model, characteristic of initial phases, we also see another model in the periodicals (and some translations made for the theatre): a laboratory, where the translator proceeds towards the translation of the whole work, experimenting and publishing it, at first in parts, in (different) journals.},

	title = {1 Deriving Thesaurus Entries from Translational Features},
	abstract = {Dyvik (1998a-b and 2002) presents a method for deriving lexical sense divisions, and feature descriptions of each sense, automatically from translational data taken from a parallel corpus ({ENPC}). The senses are grouped in semantic fields based on shared translational properties. The feature sets assigned to the senses in a field form a semilattice based on inclusion and overlap relations among the feature sets. An example of such a derived semilattice is shown below: According to the hypothesis behind the method the dominance relations in the lattice express hyperonymy/hyponymy relations among the senses, and distance in the lattice generally reflects semantic distance. Hence the lattices should contain some of the information generally found in word nets and thesauri. This is restricted to relations of semantic similarity (hyperonymy/hyponymy and synonymy), while, e.g., antonymy and meronymy probably cannot be derived from the translational data. The present paper discusses the further derivation of thesaurus entries from the information in the feature lattices. Much of the detail in the derived lattices is probably the result of accidental biases and gaps in the parallel corpus from which they were derived. The derivation of a thesaurus entry, in which words are grouped as 'hyperonyms', 'hyponyms', 'synonyms ' and 'related words ' of an entry, therefore needs to abstract away from some of the detail in the lattices, and this can obviously be done in more than one way. The following entry for the Norwegian noun 'rett ' has been derived automatically from the translationally based lattices by the principles to be described. Sense 4 corresponds to the lattice shown above: 2 Extended bases},

{ABSTRACT}

For most of us who work on the Internet, the Web is all we have ever really known. It's almost impossible to imagine a world without browsers, {URLs} and {HTTP}. But in the years leading up to Tim Berners-Lee's world-changing invention, a few visionary information scientists were exploring alternative systems that often bore little resemblance to the Web as we know it today. In this presentation, author and information architect Alex Wright will explore the heritage of these almost-forgotten systems in search of promising ideas left by the historical wayside.

The presentation will focus on the pioneering work of Paul Otlet, Vannevar Bush, and Doug Engelbart, forebears of the 1960s and 1970s like Ted Nelson, Andries van Dam, and the Xerox {PARC} team, and more recent forays like Brown's Intermedia system. We'll trace the heritage of these systems and the solutions they suggest to present day Web quandaries, in hopes of finding clues to the future in the recent technological past.

Manuel Delanda.

Manuel {DeLanda}, (born 1952 in Mexico City), is a writer, artist and distinguished philosopher who has lived in New York since 1975. Manuel De Landa is an Adjunct Associate Professor at Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation at Columbia University (New York), a Professor for Contemporary Philosophy and Science at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland, a professor at the Canisius College in Buffalo, New York, and professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Manuel De Landa is the author of War in the Age of Intelligent Machines (1991), A Thousand Years of Nonlinear History (1997), Intensive Science and Virtual Philosophy (2002) and A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity (2006). Manuel De Landa has published many articles and essays and lectured extensively in Europe and in the United States. His work focuses on the theories of the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze on one hand, and modern science, self-organizing matter, artificial life and intelligence, economics, architecture, chaos theory, history of science, nonlinear science, cellular automata on the other. De Landa became a principal figure in the "new materialism" based on his application of Deleuze's realist ontology. His universal research into "morphogenesis" - the production of the semi-stable structures out of material flows that are constitutive of the natural and social world - has been of interest to theorists across many academic and professional disciplines.

Alongside his intellectual work, Manuel {DeLanda} made several short Super 8 and 16mm films in the 1970s and early 1980s, all of which are now out of circulation. Cited by filmmaker Nick Zedd in his Cinema of Transgression Manifesto, {DeLanda} associated with many of the experimental and art filmmakers of this New York based movement. Much of {DeLanda}'s film work is inspired by his interest in philosophy and critical theory; one of his best known films, Raw Nerves, has been described as a 'Lacanian thriller' by at least one critic.},

Instead the characteri sation refers directly to sets of translationally interrelated lingui stic expressions.

	url = {http://dspace.utlib.ee/dspace/handle/10062/7767},
	shorttitle = {The translator is human too},
	abstract = {This dissertation examines the influence of language philosophical world views on practical decisions made in multilingual specialised communication - translation, term discussions, compilation and use of specialised dictionaries. For this purpose, the philosophical views are divided in two classes: linguacentric (language is primary; expressions have intrinsic meaning) and instrumental (language is a tool for communicators to achieve their goals; expressions acquire meaning only in the presence of a competent interpreter). While acknowledging the impossibility of proving the correctness of either of these, the dissertation argues that instrumentalism is more useful in practice. Data for that comes from an analysis of published specialised dictionaries, a dictionary project case study, comparison of test translations to translator attitudes, a survey of decision makers at translation service providers, and a case study of translation customer requirements. Additional results of the dissertation include an instrumentalist model of translation, an evaluation system for school translations, classifications of internal inconsistencies in dictionaries and their prevention measures, and a concept-based termbase system with a mechanism for conversion into a word-based dictionary.
Töö käsitleb keelefilosoofilise maailmavaate mõju praktilistele otsustele mitmekeelses oskussuhtluses - tõlkimises, terminiaruteludes, oskussõnastike koostamises ja kasutamises. Maailmavaatelised seisukohad on selleks jagatud kahte rühma: keelekesksed (keel on primaarne; keelenditel on sisemised tähendused) ja instrumentalistlikud (keel on vahend, mille abil suhtlejad oma eesmärke üritavad saavutada; keelendid omandavad tähenduse üksnes pädeva interpretaatori olemasolul). Tunnistades kummagi õigsuse tõestamise võimatust, on töös põhjendatud instrumentalismi suuremat praktilist kasulikkust. Materjal selleks on ilmunud oskussõnastike analüüs, sõnastikuprojekti juhtumianalüüs, proovitõlgete võrdlus tõlkijate hoiakutega, tõlkebüroode võtmeisikute küsitlus ja tõlkeklientide ootuste juhtumianalüüs. Täiendavate tulemustena on esitatud tõlkeprotsessi instrumentalistlik mudel, koolitõlgete hindamissüsteem, sõnastike sisevastuolude ja nende vältimise meetodite klassifikatsioonid ning mõistepõhine terminibaasisüsteem koos selle sõnapõhiseks sõnastikuks teisendamise mehhanismiga.},

	abstract = {The article discusses three Estonian translations of Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe into Estonian with the focus on the completeness of the translated texts and the characterisation given to these in paratextual information. While there are several translations and versions of the tex t available in E stonian that have either used a mediating language or do not proceed directly from Defoe’s novel, three editions explicitly list Defoe’s English-language Robinson Crusoe as their source text. These are Rudolf Sirge’s translation from 1950 and two editions translated by Valter Rummel that appeared in 1984 (reprinted in 2001) and 2007, respectively. The article sets out to discover the main differences between the three editions and the possible reasons that may have triggered their publication in Estonia at those particular times. In order to approach the issues, a general framework derived from descriptive translation studies is employed with an emphasis on Gideon Toury’s chrestomatic treatment of translation norms. Thus an attempt is made to detect the preliminary translational norms regarding translation policy, particularly the choice of texts to be translated, as well as the matricial norms that concern the fullness of the translated text and are part of operational norms manifested in the translator’s decisions which, in two of the cases at hand, may also have been decisions made by the editor or the censor. Rudolf Sirge’s translation appeared at a time when Estonia had fairly recently been incorporated into the Soviet Union and there was a lack of children’s literature ideologically appreciated by the regime. This may account for the packaging of the book as a work with a strong didactic bent, while its primary audience was taken to be children and young adults for whom the protagonist served as an example of a hard-working and tenacious hero to be emulated by young Soviets. The target text has been considerably shortened as references to religion and the main character’s spiritual development have been carefully purged from it. Additionally, changes have been made in the translated text, replacing references to the divine and supernatural dimensions with an increased prominence of natural and human agency.Omissions of the same type are also present in the 1984 translation by Valter Rummel. These follow a similar pattern in terms of the content of the omitted passages, while the omitted sections overlap with Sirge’s translation to some extent, mostly as concerns topics related to religion. However, the number and scale of omissions is smaller in comparison with Sirge’s translation. The translation is again presented to the reader as a book for children both by the press and by adding an afterword written by a specialist in children’s literature. The design and illustrations are typical of children’s literature, while using the work by a Byelorussian illustrator integrates the novel into the Soviet publishing system. As the decade has been de scribed by later book historians as one of crisis in children’s literature, it is not surprising that Rummel’s translation was published with a print run four times exceeding thatof the first translation. However, the paratexts are less didactic than those of Sirge’s translation and present Robinson as an embodiment of rationality and materialism rather than a paragon of labour valour.The translation published in 2007 largely copies the 1984 translation, the greatest difference being the absence of intentional omissions and the decision to follow Defoe’s story to its end, while both of the previous translations had stopped at different points within the tale. The completeness of the translation also receives special attention in the publishers blurb. The translation stands out by explicitly including adults into its prospective audience as it appeared in a series targeted at book-lovers of all ages. It can be concluded that it was acceptable during the Soviet times to curb the source text in translation while still claiming that it held the status of a representative translation; in 1950 the existence of omissions could even be frankly mentioned in the translator’s foreword. The content of the omissions correlated with topics disapproved of by the authorities of the time. The translation hailing from 1984 was, in comparison, less cautious and found it possible to include numerous elements missing from the earlier translation. The 2007 translation, however, appeared in an Estonia that had regained independence in 1991; thus, the novel’s text was published to the full. The two earlier translations were published as children’s literature at times when an acute need was felt in the society for such works. Children’s literature has also been considered more likely to be adapted to meet the needs of the target culture than works meant for adults. The 2007 translation seems to want to also engage a mature readership and follows the principles of a literary work’s integrity set out in the Berne Convention. Robinson himself as the main character has appeared to the Estonian reader in various guises: as an embodiment of quasi-Soviet labour valour, an incarnation of practical rationality of the Age of Reason, and finally as a person who also makes progress towards spiritual enlightenment. Thus, he can also be seen as an illustration of the major social change s that occurred in Estonia during the mid- and late 20th century.},

The paper looks at problems with existing accounts of 'word sense' and describes the various kinds of ways in which a word's meaning can deviate from its core meaning. An analysis is presented in which word senses are abstractions from clusters of corpus citations, in accordance with current lexicographic practice. The corpus citations, not the word senses, are the basic objects in the ontology. The corpus citations will be clustered into senses according to the purposes of whoever or whatever does the clustering. In the absence of such purposes, word senses do not exist. Word sense disambiguation also needs a set of word senses to disambiguate between. In most recent work, the set has been taken from a general-purpose lexical resource, with the assumption that the lexical resource describes the word senses of English/French/..., between which {NLP} applications will need to disambiguate. The implication of the paper is, by contrast, that word senses exist only relative to a task.},

	abstract = {The article is an attempt to pinpoint those general discursive aspects of the Young Estonia movement which more clearly contradict the hegemony of conservative positions within the cultural-political discourse of contemporary Estonia. An analysis of the rhetoric of renewal employed by Young Estonians reveals that the movement came to represent its own cultural-political practices as 1) eccentric – oriented towards that outside which they named ”Europe”, and aimed at creating internal polycentrism and differentiation; 2) eclectic – (often incoherently) assembling different pieces of different foreign languages and cultures together with the Estonian language and culture; 3) interruptive – bringing about an historical, generational and conceptual rupture with the past. In this article I show how these three determinations clash with the stress on centralization (and internality), homogeneity, and continuity characteristic of the conservative cultural-political discourse. If the latter is grounded on the clear-cut opposition of the proper and the improper, the own and the foreign, the Young Estonia movement shifts the attention to the fight for the new against the old, a struggle which presupposes the disruptive contamination of the proper with the improper, of the own with the foreign. Drawing on these observations, the foundation of the conception of culture shared by the Young Estonians is what Tuglas has called the ”aesthetic principle”. The aesthetization of culture prompts the irruption of art and artificiality into life, thus putting into question the presumed authenticity, originality and naturalness of culture – the foundation stones of the conservative cultural-political discourse. The clear-cut distinction between the internal sameness of culture and its external otherness gets replaced by the idea of an infinite movement of differentiation and translation always already internal to any culture.},

	abstract = {Although ancient verse has also been translated into Estonian with different non-equimetrical strategies, from the very beginning the equimetrical way of translation has prevailed, the purpose of which has been to convey the meter of a source text in the target text. Ancient meters are found in the Estonian tradition of translation from the end of the 19th century, when several authors undertook the translation of voluminous hexametrical texts. During the following decades, hexameter became an important meter both in original and translated poetry, first in accentual-syllabic or syllabic-accentual versification systems, later different quantitative forms were added. In the case of Estonian quantitative hexameter, a two-way evolution can be observed: the aim of the first direction is to accommodate hexameter in the prosodic reality of the Estonian language and develop a form that allows licences in the metrical structure rather than deform language, the aim of the second is to create a verse form, which, first of all, follows the patterns of ancient verse and, if necessary, forms artificial rules of quantity in order to accommodate Estonian language with the structure of hexameter.The incidence of other ancient meters, including different Ionic and Aeolic verse forms, is  considerably  lower.  During  the  obser  ved  period,  Aeolic meter s  are  conveyed  in  two  dif  fe -rent forms: in syllabic-accentual verse, where quantity plays only a rhythmic role, and syllabic-accentual-quantitative form, where the number of syllables is always strictly fixed, the distribution  of  accent s  is  governed  by  cer tain  rule s,  while  quantit y  is  more  impor tant  in strong positions and less regulated in weak positions.At the same time, we come across non-equimetrical translations as well, where instead of the original meter some other verse form has been chosen for the translation. Such rendition can be a functional equivalent, but sometimes it is just the result of a random choice. On the other hand, mostly in the case of poems in hexameter or elegiac distichs, the verseto-prose translation strategy is also used.Therefore, we can see that during the observed period ancient meters were translated with a variety of strategies. There were many different experiments and some of these resulted in a vital and sustainable tradition still viable in Estonian poetry translation.},

In this paper, we present a {TAG} based surface realiser which supports both the generation and the selection of paraphrases. To deal with the combinatorial explosion typical of such an {NP}-complete task, we introduce a number of new optimisations in a tabular, bottom-up surface realisation algorithm. We then show that one of these optimisations supports paraphrase selection. 1},

The  method is based on the construction of lattices of linguistic features. This paper  models the Semantic Mirrors Method with Formal Concept Analysis. It is argued  that the method becomes simpler to understand with the help of {FCA}. This  paper then investigates to what extent the Semantic Mirrors Method is applicable  if the linguistic resource is not a high quality parallel corpus but, instead, a  medium quality bilingual dictionary. This is a relevant question because medium  quality bilingual dictionaries are freely available whereas high quality parallel  corpora are expensive and difficult to obtain. The analysis shows that by themselves,  bilingual dictionaries are not as suitable for the Semantic Mirrors Method  but that this can be improved by applying conceptual exploration. The combined  method of conceptual exploration and Semantic Mirrors provides a useful toolkit  specifically for smaller size bilingual resources, such as ontologies and classification  systems. The last section of this paper suggests that such applications are  of interest in the area of ontology engineering.},

Sampson argues that the concept of ungrammatical or ill-formed is a delusion, based on a false conception of the kind of thing a human language is (p. 1). For the most part Sampson's case was strong and the counter-arguments from commentators less so. But with one striking exception. As Sampson acknowledges, the rules like (for English) a third-person singular word form should not take a first- or second-person subject or, a definite article precedes rather than follows the noun with which it is in a construction seem categorical: all he can do, in order to preserve his thesis, is to argue that linguists' sentences talking about grammaticality might infringe them, but he acknowledges that that argument carries little conviction, even for himself (p. 2021).

Second, bitext correspondence is noisy. This article presents methods for biasing statistical translation models to reflect these properties. Analysis of the expected behavior of these biases in the presence of sparse data predicts that they will result in more accurate models. The prediction is confirmed by evaluation with respect to a gold standard -- translation models that are biased in this fashion are significantly more accurate than a baseline knowledge-poor model. This article also shows how a statistical translation model can take advantage of various kinds of pre-existing knowledge that might be available about particular language pairs. Even the simplest kinds of language-specific knowledge, such as the distinction between content words and function words, is shown to reliably boost translation model performance on some tasks. Statistical models that are informed by pre-existing knowledge about the model domain combine the best of both the rationalist and empiricist traditions.},

Whereas translation represents the preservation of meaning when an idea is rendered in the words in a different language, paraphrasing represents the preservation of meaning when an idea is expressed using different words in the same language. We show that the two are intimately related. The major contributions of this thesis are as follows: • We define a novel technique for automatically generating paraphrases using bilingual parallel corpora, which are more commonly used as training data for statistical models of translation. • We show that paraphrases can be used to improve the quality of statistical ma-chine translation by addressing the problem of coverage and introducing a degree of generalization into the models. • We explore the topic of automatic evaluation of translation quality, and show that the current standard evaluation methodology cannot be guaranteed to correlate},

We define a paraphrase probability that allows paraphrases extracted from a bilingual parallel corpus to be ranked using translation probabilities, and show how it can be refined to take contextual information into account. We evaluate our paraphrase extraction and ranking methods using a set of manual word alignments, and contrast the quality with paraphrases extracted from automatic alignments. 1},

	abstract = {As an important chapter of Estonian literary history, Young Estonia has been relatively well researched and interpreted. However, its influence as a cultural and intellectual movement in Estonian society in the opening decades of the last century requires further study and verification. What stands reflected in Young Estonia is actually a larger groundswell of history, along with a rupture that took place throughout Estonian society in the course of its modernization. Discussions of the meaning of Young Estonia must therefore concern themselves with literary discourse, but much more so with what transpired outside the boundaries of literary pursuits, in the contexts of social and political history and the history of ideas. In view of historiography, there is no consensus on the definition of Young Estonia: it has been referred to as a movement, a group, or a cluster of seminal ideas. The founding of the group is generally located at the publication of the first Young Estonia album near the high tide of the Russian Revolution of 1905. Young Estonia disintegrated during the First World War, with its ending marked both by the publication of the fifth and final album in 1915 and by the journal Vaba Sõna (Free Word), which carried on the ideology of Young Estonia in the years 1914–1916. Although there are strong parallels between Young Estonia and similar movements and associations in Western and Central Europe in the nineteenth century, the greatest influence being exerted by the politicalliterary movement Nuori-Suomi (Young Finland), the respective group in Estonia was largely autochthonic in its time and milieu. In the rhetoric of the era of national awakening, Baltic Germans referred to Estonian national activists as ”Young Estonians”; the term was also under discussion in the Estonian press, yet there is no direct conceptual connection between this polemic and Young Estonia as a group. The Young Estonia group was mostly composed of young educated people, who according to their birth year belonged to the generational cohort of 1886, which made them 20 years old in 1905. This generational concentration explains the mutual solidarity of these young intellectuals and the spread of their radical ideas. Young Estonia’s emergence dovetailed with the Russian Revolution of 1905, but the Young Estonians who rallied to the movement of liberation formed neither a political fighting band nor a party; rather they remained a group of like-minded intellectuals. The achievements of Young Estonia should be seen in terms of their cultural and aesthetic revolution, which found expression in their publications (the Young Estonia albums, the journal Free Word), in book design, a programme for language reform, and efforts toward the renewal of style and rhetoric. An earmark of the Young Estonia movement was the furtherance of public discussion of the women’s movement and women’s education; indeed, the discussion of the ”woman question” in the works of male authors created widespread polemic. Works of literature and scholarship translated by the Young Estonians markedly enriched Estonian intellectual life on the eve of the First World War. The writings and ideas of the Young Estonians came under criticism from their contemporaries ideologically situated on both the right and the left, from conservatives on the one hand, to left-wing socialists on the other. Reviewers saw the neoromanticist thought to be characteristic of the group’s literary works as the fruit of German and French literary and philosophical influences. Young Estonians were faulted for their decadence, ”aristocratism”, eroticism, egoism, skepticism, individualism, aestheticism, etc. The leftleaning tendency of many of the members of the group was in keeping with the temper of the age; often it was a matter of conviction, though for the most part knowledge of the teachings of Marxism and socialism remained rather superficial and eclectic. The basic character of Young Estonia has generally been recognized as the gist of its famous call to action: ”More culture! Let there be more European culture! Let us be Estonians, but let us also become Europeans!” However, the interpretation of this call has been ambivalent. The spirit of the group seems to be a claim to set modern European culture in opposition to old Estonian folk culture. However, to see Young Estonia issuing a principled challenge to the mediation of German and Russian culture, which also in effect suppressed Estonian culture, would be misleading. Young Estonia’s anti-German or anti-Russian attitudes are primarily social-political and not limited to the sphere of culture. On the other hand, the European orientation of Young Estonia cannot be seen as a reneging of Estonian nationalism: it must be acknowledged that there was a diversity of views on nationalism in Estonian society at the brink of World War I. Estonian public discourse nowadays tends to use the ideological legacy of Young Estonia as a source of political arguments supporting the European Union. The question has also been raised to what extent Estonian culture meets European standards, if historically the integration of the Estonian forebears took place in the thirteenth century through military conquest, Christianization, and colonization. Thus in Young Estonians’ attitudes toward old Estonian (peasant) culture one can see an expression of the inferiority complexes of a young, urbanized generation. Attempts have been made to regard Young Estonia from postcolonial perspectives as a project devoted to the mimicry of colonial discourse, a project of self-colonization and the unconscious importation of colonial discourse into Estonian society. To see the intellectual legacy of Young Estonia as a besmirched, self-colonized culture and mindset is a statement of cultural pessimism, or even nihilism, and is unfounded from a historicist point of view. Before making such dubitable claims, the centuries-long history of Estonian culture calls for interdisciplinary analysis of the colonial past. The cultural creativity of the Young Estonia group in the period between two Russian revolutions signals the birth of a professional and elite culture for the first time in the history of the Estonians. This corresponds to the aspirations and ideals of a new, educated generation, not as yet very numerous, as well as to the Young Estonians’ esteem for literature and art as individual creations of aesthetic value. A large part of classical Estonian culture today can be genetically traced to the legacy of Young Estonia, which marked the beginning of modern Estonian culture},

	abstract = {Halliday's Systemic Functional Linguistics ({SFL}) often pays tribute to one of the great 20th century figures in European Linguistics, Louis Hjelmslev, and his theory of Glossematics. This is surprising because Glossematics is a formally oriented, strictly immanent approach to language while {SFL} is a functional theory focusing on language as a social semiotic. This paper offers an examination of both theories and attempts to trace similarities and differences on a number of issues with which they share a theoretical concern: the role of paradigmatic relations, the notions of function, text, stratification and immanence, and the overall descriptive goals in linguistics. The paper concludes that except for the basic recognition of the primacy of paradigmatic relations and the abstract idea of the stratification of the content plane, there is little or no similarity between Glossematics and {SFL}. In fact, many of the references to Glossematics in {SFL} writings may give the reader an inaccurate impression of Hjelmslev. More generally, while accepting that finding inspiration in a theory does not necessarily involve an obligation to remain faithful to that theory, the paper argues that we all still owe it to earlier generations of scholars to recognize their work for what it really was.},

	abstract = {Textual aligning consists in pairing segments (e.g. sentences or phrases) that are translational equivalents across corpora of translations. An interesting application of textual aligning is the automatic extraction of bilingual lexicons. As it has been pointed out during previous evaluation campaigns, such as Arcade, lexical aligning remains problematic. In order to solve problems of consistency linked with the concept of translational compositionality, a redefinition of lexical aligning task is proposed, introducing the concept of lexical correspondence. Simple techniques dedicated to lexical correspondences extraction are then evaluated. Thus, it appears that adapted statistical filters allow to extract very accurately significant regularities that are relevant at the contrastive level. More generally, these methods prove to be adapted not only for bilingual lexicons extraction: they could be used to study a wide range of contrastive phenomena on empirical basis.

What position is given to the movement by the writer(s) of the various sketches on Estonian literature between 1908 and 2007, and how important are the writers of the group in the eyes of literary historians? 2. How is the movement represented in the collective (public) memory of Estonia, e.g. do we find members of the movement on stamps or banknotes or in street names? 3. How do people in Estonia remember the literary production of the members of the group: what are the most important texts people read today, and how are these texts linked to the Young Estonia movement? 4. Finally, how is the movement represented outside Estonia, i.e. in the reception of Estonian literature abroad? Which texts have been translated, which authors are well-known abroad? In answering these questions the author concludes that the Young Estonia movement was much less important than has been assumed with respect to the production of literature, i.e. yielding literary texts that have been recognized and read up till the present. Rather, the lasting importance of Young Estonia has been in the organization of literary life.},

Based on a literature review of the concept of equivalence and analysis of the features of legal discourses, the article adopts a semiotic approach to the translation of legal terms.

The paper also provides some linguistic strategies for realizing terminological equivalence in legal translation, such as the use of a semantic reference scheme, componential analysis, and the principle of productivity and economy.

Microsoft's {NodeXL} is a free, open-source {SNA} plug-in for use with Excel. It provides instant graphical representation of relationships of complex networked data. But it goes further than other {SNA} tools -- {NodeXL} was developed by a multidisciplinary team of experts that bring together information studies, computer science, sociology, human-computer interaction, and over 20 years of visual analytic theory and information visualization into a simple tool anyone can use. This makes {NodeXL} of interest not only to end-users but also to researchers and students studying visual and network analytics and their application in the real world. In Analyzing Social Media Networks with {NodeXL}, members of the {NodeXL} development team up provide readers with a thorough and practical guide for using the tool while also explaining the development behind each feature. Blending the theoretical with the practical, this book applies specific {SNA} instructions directly to {NodeXL}, but the theory behind the implementation can be applied to any {SNA}. *Walks readers through using {NodeXL} while explaining the theory and development behind each step, providing takeaways that can apply any {SNA} *Demonstrates how visual analytics research can be applied to {SNA} tools for the mass market *Presents readers with case studies using {NodeXL} on popular networks like email, Facebook, Twitter, and wikis},

As the number of ontologies that are made publicly available and accessible on the Web increases steadily, so does the need for applications to use them. A single ontology is no longer enough to support the tasks envisaged by a distributed environment like the Semantic Web. Multiple ontologies need to be accessed from several applications. Mapping could provide a common layer from which several ontologies could be accessed and hence could exchange information in semantically sound manners. Developing such mappings has been the focus of a variety of works originating from diverse communities over a number of years. In this article we comprehensively review and present these works. We also provide insights on the pragmatics of ontology mapping and elaborate on a theoretical approach for defining ontology mapping.},

	abstract = {Functional analyses of grammatical phenomena, and the functionalist approaches that promote them, are appealing to those who believe that an integrated view of language structure and language function is desirable. But functional analyses have been held to founder on basic grammatical facts that are taken to support the autonomy of grammar. The concept of autonomy is a complex one, and at least two different notions are found in current linguistic theory: arbitrariness and self-containedness. These notions of autonomy apply either to the syntactic component of the grammar, or (a more recent claim) to the grammar itself, with respect to change, use, and acquisition. The arbitrariness of syntax must be accepted; and many functional analyses are compatible with selfcontainedness. However, mixed formal/functional analyses provide an argument against the self-containedness of syntax, and in fact even many formal theories of syntax accept non-self-containedness. The arbitrariness of grammatical knowledge must also be accepted; and many functional analyses of the dynamic process affecting grammar are compatible with self-containedness. An argument against the self-containedness of grammar comes not from these functional analyses but from sociolinguistics.},

	abstract = {The present article looks at a section of Estonian translation history, through the criticism and practice of translation of an extremely prolific and well-known Estonian translator and reviewer of translations Marta Sillaots (1887–1969). Touching upon the issue of the aging of translational texts as well as the norms of translational behavior in the Estonia of the first half of the 20th century, the article makes use of Peeter Torop’s concepts of the explicit poetics of translation (theoretical ideas about translation expressed in paratexts) and implicit poetics of translation (translational choices inside translations) in an attempt to map the translational thought of Marta Sillaots. Firstly, the explicit poetics of translation of Marta Sillaots is analyzed by focusing on the recurring topics and keywords in Sillaots’ translation reviews, published in a monthly literary journal Eesti Kirjandus during the 1920s and 1930s. Secondly, the implicit poetics of Marta Sillaots’ translations is analyzed based on a comparative corpus of two novels translated by Sillaots and their later editions: Romain Rolland’s Jean-Christophe 1936 and 1958 (edited by Henno Rajandi) and Charles Dickens’ David Copperfield 1937 and 1991 (edited by Lia Rajandi). Although the originals are held close at hand, the translations are approached as facts in Estonian cultural space, and thus the focus is on the translation rather than on the original. In comparison with the first edition, the changes made by the editors reveal a pattern of movement towards greater fluency by standardizing the word order, adding linking devices and making the constructions confirm to the rules of target language.The comparison of the explicit and implicit poetics of Sillaots reveals certain conformities as well as inconsistencies. In reviewing translations by other translators, Sillaots traditionally balances between the terms good and bad translation. Firstly, for her, a precondition for a good translation is the connection between the translator and the original that can be expressed by a theoretical interest of the translator in the original author or in a similarity of their literary styles. Secondly, Sillaots emphasizes the need to lead the reader to the translational text by a comprehensive foreword, something that she, as a translator, always tried to do. But most importantly, Sillaots finds it necessary for the translators to educate the Estonian readers, first by the choice of authors to translate and second by the language of translation, which has to be in accordance with the norms of grammar and style of the target language.However, the comparative analysis of her translations to their later editions shows that, although never adding any lexical items, Sillaots often used sentence structure, word order as well as minimal collocation in order to convey what, according to her, was the style of the original author. This practice distanced her translations somewhat from what is regarded as adherence to the rules of Estonian text formation. Sillaots remains an important part of Estonian translation history because of the number of her translations as well as for her poetics of translation.},

His major direct contribution was through the use of corpora in monolingual learners dictionaries, but his interest in language inevitably led him on to look at multilingual matters; even though he was never directly involved in traditional bilingual lexicography. This paper shows how Sinclairs contribution through work on translation equivalence led on to the series of highly innovative bilingual ‘Bridge dictionaries’. It also tries to gauge his wider influence in the field of bilingual lexicography.},

	volume = {1},
	issn = {1736-6852},

	doi = {10.7592/methis.v1i1-2.479},
	abstract = {From the beginning of the 20th century on, the activities of the Young Estonia literary movement have had a significant influence on the development of Estonian culture. The group published five Young Estonia albums (1905–1915), the magazine Young Estonia, devoted to science, literature, and the arts (1910– 1911), and the newspaper Vaba Sõna (1914–1916, Free Word). The core of the group was composed of five or six active writers who maintained lively interactions with art and theatre circles. The publications of the Young Estonia Press brought about a revolutionary turn in the design and printing styles of the Estonian-language book. The questions of Young Estonia’s role and meaning have intrigued the Estonian cultural public at different times and in different ways. Young Estonia brought to cultural consciousness liberal views on the interpretation of art as well as an elitist aesthetics. At different times their openness to Europe irritated both the nationalist-minded and internationalists; thus the reception of the Young Estonia movement has been polemical throughout Estonian cultural history. Elapsed time has both opened the way for broader generalizations and, conversely, created a need to reconstruct the cultural context of the beginning of the 20th century. Polemic around Young Estonia was certainly caused by the group as a whole; however, in this article the role of individual members is also highlighted. It is emphasized that the political and aesthetic ideas of the Young Estonians changed synchronously with social conditions, from the 1905 Russian revolution to the world war that ravaged Europe. If the early part of this period saw a more social and nationalist bent to their thinking, then in the years of reaction, positions were taken that were more in keeping with l’art pour l’art. Young Estonia was not a hierarchical organization; rather, its small core group was composed of a narrow circle of friends with various political and aesthetic views: linguist Johannes Aavik, poets Villem Grünthal and Gustav Suits, prose writer and critic Friedebert Tuglas, and critic and translator Bernhard Linde; Finnish-Estonian writer Aino Kallas also belonged to the inner circle. As shown by private correspondences, personal relationships played a major role in the group’s activities; statements on behalf of the group as a whole were only made in the context of parrying the attacks of conservative critics. The main force unifying the members of the Young Estonia group was dissatisfaction with the state of Estonian language, literature, and mentality at the beginning of the 20th century. In addition to their call for a new aesthetic, members of the group wished to hold up their own original work as models. Writers of the Young Estonia group produced little in the way of original literature: their main strength was as critics and essayists, theoretical articulators of a new direction. First and foremost among their contributions – particularly in the case of Johannes Aavik, was a steady, principled struggle for the cultivation of the Estonian language: on this topic they published manifestoes, explanatory articles, and writings of a linguistic-theoretical nature. Along with supplementing the language, there was a joint commitment to the style and form of the work of art. Thus, the second major contribution of Young Estonia was giving a new meaning to the concepts of ”author” and ”writer”. Following the example of Georg Brandes, they began writing a new type of biography of Estonian writers, and oriented themselves to the concept of national literature. For example, Gustav Suits glorified Kristian Jaak Peterson (1801-1822) as the ”first Estonian poet”. The Young Estonian slogan, ”Let us be Estonians, but let us also become Europeans!” lost its meaning during the First World War, when the ideal of Europe collapsed. Those who had been rebels up to that point now became the leaders of Estonian literary life; Gustav Suits became the first university professor of Estonian literature. The Young Estonians had shown their force and established a place for themselves. In Estonian criticism today, approaches drawn from postcolonialism (such as self-colonization) have often been used. In this article, analysis is based rather, and alternatively, on cultural influence and culture transfer. In a time of great cultural ruptures, searching for external models from European modernist culture was the only way imaginable for Young Estonia. One of the most important questions in this regard is the role of German and Russian culture, and this topic is elaborated upon in the current collection of articles. In order to provide a context for the articles in this collection, the co-editors initially provide a panoramic overview of the reception of Young Estonia in the different periods of Estonian history (Young Estonia’s contemporaries, 1905–1915; the Estonian republic, 1918–1940; Soviet Estonia and the literature of the exile 1944–1991). For example, in the Stalinist period in the 1950s, Young Estonia was condemned along with other decadent-bourgeois movements; at the same time, Estonian literary scholars in exile focused their research on the major figures of Young Estonia, particularly Gustav Suits. In the 1960s through the 1980s, the Young Estonians became widely anthologized authors – Young Estonia was canonized, though its political and social context could only be broached with caution. On the 100th anniversary of Young Estonia (2005), it once again became a focus of interest for Estonian literary studies; topics formerly difficult to discuss due to censorship or the lack of sources came to the fore. Based on Young Estonia’s clarion call, ”More European culture!” researchers began systematically to search for a European context for the Estonian intellectual world at the beginning of the 21st century. Literary scholars were joined in this search by historians, semioticians, gender studies scholars, art historians, and new, exciting points of view have emerged for the understanding of Young Estonia. Two international conferences were held at the Estonian Literary Museum in Tartu in celebration of the 100th anniversary of Young Estonia: ”Ten Years of Young Estonia: Time and Literature”, 2005; and ”Ten Years of Young Estonia {II}: Ideals, Aesthetics, Meaning”, 2007. The current collection gathers 20 articles on Young Estonia which have not been previously published. Together with articles published elsewhere by Epp Annus, Lea Pild, Sirje Olesk, and Katre Talviste, based on their presentations at the same conferences, the contributions in this volume are shaping a new 21st century discourse of Young Estonia. The main message of the collection is valorizing the cultural openness of Young Estonia, and the opportunity to consider the movement as a whole in the context of the collision and adaptation of different ideologies.},

The method exploits recent advances in word alignment and word clustering based on automatic extraction of translation equivalents and being supported by available aligned wordnets for the languages in the corpus. The wordnets are aligned to the Princeton Wordnet, according to the principles established by {EuroWordNet}. The evaluation of the {WSD} system, implementing the method described herein showed very encouraging results. The same system used in a validation mode, can be used to check and spot alignment errors in multilingually aligned wordnets as {BalkaNet} and {EuroWordNet}.},

	abstract = {The language faculty is probably the most distinctive feature of our species,
and endows us with a unique ability to exchange highly structured
information. In written language, information is encoded by the
concatenation of basic symbols under grammatical and semantic constraints.
As is also the case in other natural information carriers, the resulting
symbolic sequences show a delicate balance between order and disorder. That
balance is determined by the interplay between the diversity of symbols and
by their specific ordering in the sequences. Here we used entropy to
quantify the contribution of different organizational levels to the overall
statistical structure of language.




We computed a relative entropy measure to quantify the degree of ordering in
word sequences from languages belonging to several linguistic families.
While a direct estimation of the overall entropy of language yielded values
that varied for the different families considered, the relative entropy
quantifying word ordering presented an almost constant value for all those
families.




Our results indicate that despite the differences in the structure and
vocabulary of the languages analyzed, the impact of word ordering in the
structure of language is a statistical linguistic universal.},

Machine translation systems do not produce translations with high enough quality to be accepable in many situations, particularly for the localization of technical documentation. However, existing translations are an extremely valuable resource which can be exploited with software systems to improve the efficiency of human translation.

	abstract = {According to Boris Tomashevski it is very important to differentiate writers with a biography from writers without a biography. In the case of writers with a biography, the life story becomes and important supplement to reading and understanding the text. It makes little difference whether the story is true or not. This article takes a look at the 9th century Japane se poet Ono no Komachi, who is considered to be one of the greate st poet s of the Early Classical period. Although her poems were most likely written by many different authors (some presumably even men), the biographical narratives supplementing the texts have created a singular image of the author, which hides the underlying multiplicity of writers. The passion inherent in the poems has fuelled the imagination of storytellers, who have envisioned the author as a beautiful proud woman who was utterly dissatisfied with the way the natural course of things slowly deprived her of the beauty she was once famous for. Medieval Nō plays portray her as coldhearted lover who treats her men cruelly and ends her life as an impoverished old hag living in a dilapidated hut somewhere in the outskirts of the capital. Although almost nothing is known about the historical author and we can be confident that the different accounts of her life are fictional in nature, the subsequent translators and commentaries of her work cannot discard this imaginary tale, since it helps to clarify the ambiguities inherent in Komachi’s rethorically complex writing, which makes extensive use of pivot-words and associative techniques.This article focuses mainly on the Estonian translations of the poem number 113 in the Kokinshū (Collection of Early and Modern Japanese Poetry, 905) and discusses the possibilities inherent in the original text, based on the modern edition of the anthology. Estonian translators Rein Raud and Uku Masing have both resorted to the traditional image of a proud (k yōman) woman, which can be traced back to various historical sources and commentaries on this particular poem. This becomes a key issue in understanding the nature of the authors gaze, since the meaning ‘long rain’ (naga-ame) is skillfully embedded in the verb ‘to gaze’ (nagame) the translator has to find ways to create a nondual experience, where the subject and the object become one in the act of gazing. Rein Raud, a trained Japanese philologist, solves this issue by talking about the vanity and the impermanence of world (mujōkan), which reinforces the traditional Buddhist reading of text (everything in this world passes away – flowers wither and women lose their beauty). In his rendering, Ono no Komachi becomes a philosopher, who understands the nature of reality and almost overcomes her attachment to beauty. Uku Masing’s theoretical commentaries on waka show that although he did not master the Japanese language, he understood that Japanese contained ‘magic words’ (nõiasõna), which should be preserved in translation. Thus he opts for pilgusadu (rain of gazes), which comes close to the ambivalent nature of the original. Uku Masing’s transla-tion reminds Burton Watson’s reading (The beauty of the flowers faded – / no one cared – / and I  w a t c h e d  m y s e l f / grow old in the world / as the long rains were falling), which outlines the vanity of the women who are constantly worried about their looks. The gaze turns back at women herself – she is constantly worried how other see her and whether they notice how she is getting older. The image of the author created by these translators is very different (the gaze of the philosopher as opposed to the gaze of the woman obsessed with beauty), but both readings are supported by the ambiguous nature of the original.Looking at different translations, we see that modern translations fall into a long line of different readings, which start with the compiler of Kokinshū Ki no Tsurayuki who envisioned Komachi as ‘beautiful sick woman’ and talked about the certain ‘lack of strength’ in her waka, which, in his view, made her poems especially good. The translators have used this as a reliable source, since it is the oldest commentary, but some confusion arises from the fact that Tsurayuki is not describing the historical person, but the effect her texts have on the reader. This article uses terminology coined by Wolf Schmid, which helps to differentiate concrete author (historical person) and the abstract author (image created by the reading). Schmid tells us that the abstract author is constructed by the readers on the basis of the creator as she shows herself inside her creative deeds. In this theoretical framework the translator appear s as the reader who is influenced both by the supplemented life stor y, his own experience of reading the texts and, last but not least, the way that a male translator gazes at the beautiful woman gazing at the withering flowers in the garden. Acknowledging the multiplicity of abstract authors created in different readings of texts leads to very bold translations such as Hasso Krull’s translation presented in this article, which envisons Komachi as a modern, tired woman who suffers from insomnia and does not recognize herself in the mirror.},

	abstract = {The topic of this article is the literary discourse of Young Estonia; its relations with other important Estonian literary discourses from the beginning of the 20th century, and its relations with colonial cultural discourse. First, I give an overview of the basic positions of the Young Estonians’ literary discourse, the main shapers of which were Friedebert Tuglas, Gustav Suits, later on Johannes Semper as well. Next, I present the basic principles of three Estonian literary discourses from the beginning of the 20th century, which were also important to the Young Estonians: nationalist-naturalistic (close-to-life); socialist/ class-based, and 20th century modernist. The Young Estonians began as nationalists and/or socialists. During the formation of Young Estonia’s discourse at the end of the first and beginning of the second decade of the 20th century, 20th century modernism began, which the Young Estonians regarded first and foremost with irony. The Young Estonians’ literary discourse is a mixture of aestheticism, decadence, symbolism, romanticism, and classicism. The point of departure for the Young Estonian approach to literature was eurocentrism. They took a superior and negative view of existing Estonian literature, which they regarded as having fallen drastically behind Europe. Since it was unable to build on its own foundation, it had to borrow from Europe. The discourse’s understandings of cultural values – theory, reading, knowledge, ready-made culture, derive from the centrality of the dynamic of borrowing. New culture could be created freely, without the support of previous local tradition; it was to be an elite culture, while the writer remained an individualist. Literature was to follow the principle of art for art’s sake; aesthetics and the form of the work of art were basic criteria. The formal ideals of the work of art were classicist: unity, integrity (wholeness), harmony, order, logic, etc. Thirdly, I outline the basic positions of colonial thinking about culture, and compare the Young Estonian approaches to literature with colonial thought. The foundation of colonialism is eurocentrism: if Europe is the core; everything else belongs to the periphery, and regarded from the outset as of lesser inherent worth: colonialism is characterized by a superior and negative attitude toward local culture. The colonizing culture interprets its own values and experiences as universals; these are congruent with the outlines of what is deemed to be ”European” culture. The mission of colonialism is to bring the periphery into the sphere of influence of the enlightened core. Though colonial thinking does not commit itself to any specific artistic movement or style, its most important tenet with regard to evaluating art is classicist, emphasizing enduring values and good ”handiwork”. The bases for the creation of colonial culture are ready-made models and categories, and the outcome of colonization is culture constructed according to a model. The outcome of the analysis is that the Young Estonian way of thinking is in close consonance with the colonial way of thinking. Those attitudes that Young Estonians did not adopt, or those they relinquished and discarded, are in opposition to it. My own basic claim is that the Young Estonians unconsciously carried a colonial way of thinking, and that they might be considered to be self-colonizers.},

	abstract = {We first reconsider the role of lexicographers in word-sense disambiguation as a computational task, as providers of both legacy material (dictionaries) and special test material for competitions like {SENSEVAL}. We suggest that the standard fine-grained division of senses and (larger) homographs by a lexicographer for use by a human reader may not be an appropriate goal for the computational {WSD} task. We argue that the level of sense-discrimination that {NLP} needs corresponds roughly to homographs, though we discuss psycholinguistic evidence that there are broad sense divisions with some etymological derivation (i.e. non-homographic) that are as distinct for humans as homographic ones and they may be part of the broad class of sensedivisions we seek to identify here. Fifteen years or more of {WSD} research has shown that it is this kind of discrimination that existing {WSD} programs are able to capture at the {\textasciitilde}95\% success level, whereas the full lexicographicallyderived division of senses seems to remain too hard for both programs and human discriminators. We link this discussion to the observation that major {NLP} tasks like {MT} and {IR} seem not to need independent {WSD} modules of the sort produced in the research field, even though they are undoubtedly doing {WSD} by other means. Our conclusion is that {WSD} should continue to focus on these broad discriminations, at which it can do very well, thereby possibly offering the close-to-100\% success that {IR} needs (especially search-engine, rather than classic long-query) {IR}, and assume that this is what most {NLP} requires, with the possible exception of very fine questions of target word choice in {MT}. This proposal can be seen as reorienting {WSD} to what it can actually perform at the standard success levels, but we argue that this, rather...},

In this article we will provide an overview of the process of international standardization and discuss some of the international standards currently being developed under the auspices of {ISO}/{TC} 37, a technical committee called “Terminology and other Language and Content Resources”. After that the relationship between the {TEI} Guidelines and these specifications, according to their formal model, notation format, and annotation model, will be discussed.

	abstract = {This paper consists of two sections: first, I return to the question of precisely which contextual factors are at work in metaphorical interpretation, and of the relation between asserted, presupposed and implied information; the upshot of this will be a renewed emphasis on metaphor as a discourse phenomenon. Second, I sketch a preliminary argument as to what a social practice account of metaphor might look like. Recent explorations of the contextual factors involved in the interpretation ofmetaphor make crucial use of David Kaplan’s Logic of Demonstratives, with its sophisticated treatment of context-dependence, and of the work on assertion developed by Stalnaker and others. All these approaches take contextual factors or parameters like that of speaker, time and place of utterance, etc., as given or primitive. Recent anthropological research, however, suggests that our practices constitute not only the contents of our utterances but also their contexts. Another recent development in linguistic anthropology is an increased attention to so-called language ideologies or metalinguistic beliefs, i.e., folk theories about the character and functioning of language. These insights suggest that metaphor is so thoroughly dependent on variable contextual and metalinguistic factors that it may well dissolve as a natural kind. At the very least, they suggest a shift away from the view of metaphor as a decontextualized sentence- or utterance-level phenomenon occurring in literate practices, which is still tacitly assumed in much literature on the topic.},

In an attempt to implement as language independent a method as possible, the application's methodology features statistical inductive techniques coupled with symbolic processing techniques catering for the analysis of specific language phenomena. The method presupposes parallel texts and identifies translational equivalences at the word or multiword unit level for those cases that such an equivalence holds true. Parallel texts are first aligned at the sentence level and grammatically analyzed. Noun phrase grammars extract noun phrases, and statistical evaluation yields the most coherent multiword units on either side . Translation candidates of word or multiword units are evaluated by a similarity metric defined by the co-occurrence frequency and independent frequencies of the units . The method has been tested on an English - Greek corpus consisting of texts relevant to software systems, yielding 94\% accurate translations . [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

	shorttitle = {Speech Perception as a Cognitive Process},
	abstract = {In this paper we describe several attempts to model speech perception in terms of a processing system in which knowledge and processing is distributed over large numbers of highly interactive -- but computationally primitive -- elements, all working in parallel to jointly determine the result of the perceptual process. We begin by discussing the properties of speech which we feel demand a parallel interactive processing system, and then review previous attempts to model speech perception, both psycholinguistic and machine-based. We then present the results of a computer simulation of one version of an interactive activation model of speech, based loosely on Marslen-Wilson's {COHORT} model. One virtue of the model is that it is capable of word recognition and phonemic restoration without depending on preliminary segmentation of the input into phonemes. However, this version of the model has several deficiencies -- among them are excessive sensitivity to speech rate and excessive dependence on accurate information about the beginnings of words. To address some of these deficiencies, we describe an alternative called the {TRACE} model. In this version of the model, interactive activation processes take place within a structure which serves as a dynamic working memory. This structure permits the model to capture contextural influences in which the perception of a portion of the input stream is influenced by what follows it as well as what preceeds it in the speech signal.

Prior work to relate two {IE} patterns was reported by (Shinyama et al., 2002). However, in this attempt only limited forms of expressions could be obtained. Furthermore, the obtained paraphrases were limited to existing {IE} patterns only. We are interested in collecting various kinds of clues, including similar {IE} patterns themselves, to connect two patterns. In this paper, we tried to obtain more varied paraphrases.

	abstract = {The aim of this article is to provide an overview of translations of English literature into Estonian between 1779 and 1917. There is an attempt to analyse the texts by describing them on the basis of, or in their departure from, a text or texts that chronologically and logically precede them. The discussion includes the nature of the transfer and the changes that have been made to the text, either because they existed in the source or mediating text or because of the expectations or requirements in the receptor, i.e. Estonian culture. The translated texts are seen in their historical-cultural context. For the analysis, a corpus of translated texts – religious, fiction, drama and non-fiction (published in a book form) was compiled. The general orientation of Estonia until the 1880s was to the German cultural sphere. So the first translations of English literature were made via a mediating language, which was German. English Puritan writers were introduced by the Pietist missionaries with the aim of spreading their teachings in the second half of the 18th century. At about the same time the narrative element was introduced into stories with religious content. Some internationally popular stories, e.g. the Inkle and Yarico story, later robinsonades, stories of slavery and plant at ion life, as well as Amer ican Indian st or ies wer e also t r anslat ed fr om Ger man. However, until  1875  ver  y  few  translations  of  English  literature  into  E stonian were  published.  The  last quarter of the 19th century saw an explosion in literary production: there was a substantial increase  both  in  the  number  of  translations  of  English  literature  into  E stonian  as  well  as diversification of genres. This continued into the first decade of the 20th  centur y,  when  the sociopolitical situation in Estonia changed. In addition, books came to be translated directly from  English,  although  many  translations  of  English  literature  were  still  made  via  German and, to a lesser extent, via Russian, Swedish or Finnish. Thus, English literature often reached the Estonian audiences in a mediated form. The selection of authors and books, the structure of the texts and the overall meaning and tone of the texts often depended on the mediating text or culture. However, many changes were made by the translator: explanations of new words and phrases, pronunciations, references to the Estonian reader, etc. Here paratexts are quite important: the titles often explained the content or the purpose of the book and referred to the language from which the book was translated. In the prefaces, translators or publishers explained their aims or connected the book to discussions in society (e.g. the translator of Uncle Tom’s Cabin connected it to anabolitionist argument of slavery as a moral evil; on the other hand, the editor connected it to the Estonian fight for freedom; the translation of The Pathfinder was related to the polemics in the Estonian newspapers over migration). However, in very many cases it was difficult to positively identify the mediating or source language or text and to establish whether it was a translation of English literature.},

	abstract = {Friedebert Tuglas’ Felix Ormusson and James Joyce’s Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man were finished in the same year – 1914, but the writing of both novels took the writers almost a decade, a time of searching and exile for both of them. Joyce completely rewrote the initial draft of his novel, entitled Stephen Hero, experimenting with basic forms, such as the short prose piece he called the ”epiphany”. Tuglas’ Felix Ormusson was initially conceived as a three-volume picaresque novel, which was distilled into a single volume of prose fragments arranged as a diary novel: the rest was left unfinished, and exists only in the form of two novella-length fragments. A comparative juxtaposition of the two novels is suggestive, not just because of parallels between the authors’ life trajectories and creative biographies, nor because of similarities between the protagonists, not even by the somewhat deceptive placement in the rubric of the 'Künstlerroman'. Both novels partake of ironic autobiography, and both resonate with the subgenre of the ”diary novel”, increasingly in vogue in European literature of the fin-de-siècle, modelled in turn on the published journal intime. Felix Ormusson and Stephen Dedalus were their authors’ long-time fictional fellow travellers, alter ego’s, in whose confessions one can read the pressing desire to emerge from the provinces and peripheries of Europe toward broader, metropolitan cultural horizons. The protagonists’ quests open onto the problematics of modernism – the split between life and literature, and the burden of ”overreflexivity” which obstructed literary creation and sentimental education. Behind the aesthetic polemics of both novels are shadows of the politics of the era: for Felix Ormusson, the aftermath of the 1905 revolution and political exile, and in the milieu of young Stephen Dedalus, the entanglement of national politics and the Catholic church. In the first part of the article, both Tuglas’ and Joyce’s novels are considered in terms of their swerving away from the genre of the 'Künstlerroman', and the representation of the problem of the self. The language of Felix Ormusson’s diary is a conflicted mixed style, full of quotations, cliches and images that move restlessly back and forth between the registers of the ”country hick” (mats) and the imitated ”city slicker” (vurle). The opposition of ”hick” and ”slicker” is also played out in the love triangle with the two sisters Helene and Marion, and Felix’s opposition to his friend Johannes. ”Over-reflexivity” culminates in Felix’ banal flight from the scene of his abortive summer romances at the end of the novel. For Joyce’s Stephen Dedalus, rebellion and self-creation grow out of the painful initiation experience of the Jesuit retreat in the centre of the novel, which catalyzes his rejection of church and faith, and the embracing of a secular aesthetic quest through the obird-girl” episode on the beach near Dublin. The second part of the article frames both novels generically in relation to the modern diary novel: if Felix Ormusson could be considered an imitation of the journal intime form, Stephen Dedalus arrives at the diary at the threshold of self-defining exile. The third part of the article compares the meanings of exile, nationalism and aesthetic cosmopolitanism in Tuglas’ and Joyce’s novels.},

I hope you like it and even if you dont I would like to heard what you think in the comments section. Also I know that at points the audio does not match the text so you do not have to write that. It is because I copied the transcript off of Stephen's website and it was not 100\% exactly what he said and i did not notice until I was well underway. However these cases are few and far between. 

Just incase you were wondering the programs I used to make this were all by Adobe. Mostly After Effects but also Flash and Illustrator. Flash for the changing background colour transitions and illustrator for putting the words in to the shape of 'language' before loading it into After Effects to animate.

	abstract = {Abstract. Parallel corpora encode extremely valuable linguistic knowledge about paired languages, both in terms of vocabulary and syntax. A professional translation of a text represents a series of linguistic decisions made by the translator in order to convey as faithfully as possible the meaning of the original text and to produce a “natural ” text from the perspective of a native speaker of the target language. The “naturalness ” of a translation implies not only the grammaticality of the translated text, but also style and cultural or social specificity. We describe a program that exploits the knowledge embedded in the parallel corpora and produces a set of translation equivalents (a translation lexicon). The program uses almost no linguistic knowledge, relying on statistical evidence and some simplifying assumptions. Our experiments were conducted on the {MULTEXT}-{EAST} multilingual parallel corpus (Orwell’s “1984”), and the evaluation of the system performance is presented in some detail in terms of precision, recall and processing time. We conclude by briefly mentioning some applications of the automatic extracted lexicons for text and speech processing. Keywords: alignment, bitext, lemmatization, tagging, translation lexicon},

Within our framework, we carry out a large number of experiments to understand better and explain why phrase-based models outperform word-based models. Our empirical results, which hold for all examined language pairs, suggest that the highest levels of performance can be obtained through relatively simple means: heuristic learning of phrase translations from word-based alignments and lexical weighting of phrase translations. Surprisingly, learning phrases longer than three words and learning phrases from high-accuracy wordlevel alignment models does not have a strong impact on performance. Learning only syntactically motivated phrases degrades the performance of our systems. 1},

The authors explain the tricks of locality-sensitive hashing and stream processing algorithms for mining data that arrives too fast for exhaustive processing. The {PageRank} idea and related tricks for organizing the Web are covered next. Other chapters cover the problems of finding frequent itemsets and clustering.

If one requires part-of-speech tagging for some task, it is now possible to obtain high performance off the shelf; if one needs morphological analysis, software and lexical data are not too hard to find. In both cases, performance of stateof -the-art systems is respectable, if not perfect, and the fundamentals of the dominant approaches (noisy channel models for tagging, two-level morphology) are by now well understood.

Traditional graph-based approaches create and then cluster a graph, in which each vertex corresponds to a word that co-occurs with the target word, and edges between vertices are weighted based on the co-occurrence frequency of their associated words. In contrast, in our approach each vertex corresponds to a collocation that co-occurs with the target word, and edges between vertices are weighted based on the co-occurrence frequency of their associated collocations. A smoothing technique is applied to identify more edges between vertices and the resulting graph is then clustered. Our evaluation under the framework of {SemEval}-2007 {WSI} task shows the following: (a) our approach produces less sense-conflating clusters than those produced by traditional graph-based approaches, (b) our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art results. 1},

We evaluate the impact of using clustering information for {CLLS} by applying the {WSD} method to the {SemEval}-2010 {CLLS} data set. Our system performs better on the ’out-of-ten ’ measure than the systems that participated in the {SemEval} task, and is ranked medium on the other measures. We analyze the results of this evaluation and discuss avenues for a better overall integration of unsupervised sense clustering in this setting. 1},

	abstract = {Word Sense Disambiguation ({WSD}) is an intermediate task that serves as a means to an end defined by the application in which it is to be used. However, different applications have varying disambiguation needs which should have an impact on the choice of the method and of the sense inventory used. The tendency towards application-oriented {WSD} becomes more and more evident, mostly because of the inadequacy of predefined sense inventories and the inefficacy of application-independent methods in accomplishing specific tasks. In this article, we present a data-driven method of sense induction, which combines contextual and translation information coming from a bilingual parallel training corpus. It consists of an unsupervised method that clusters semantically similar translation equivalents of source language ({SL}) polysemous words. The created clusters are projected on the {SL} words revealing their sense distinctions. Clustered equivalents describing a sense of a polysemous word can be considered as more or less commutable translations for an instance of the word carrying this sense. The resulting sense clusters can thus be used for {WSD} and sense annotation, as well as for lexical selection in translation applications. halshs-00285407, version 1- 5 Jun 2008 1.},

We operationalize distributional similarity in a general framework for large corpora, and describe a new method to generate similar terms in context. Our evaluation shows that distributional similarity is able to produce highquality lexical resources in an unsupervised and knowledge-free way, and that our highly scalable similarity measure yields better scores in a {WordNet}-based evaluation than previous measures for very large corpora. Evaluating on a lexical substitution task, we find that our contextualization method improves over a non-contextualized baseline across all parts of speech, and we show how the metaphor can be applied successfully to part-of-speech tagging. A number of ways to extend and improve the contextualization method within our framework are discussed. As opposed to comparable approaches, our framework defines a model of lexical expansions in context that can generate the expansions as opposed to ranking a given list, and thus does not require existing lexical-semantic resources.},

	abstract = {Electronic dictionaries covering all natural language levels are very relevant for the human use as well as for the automatic processing use, namely those constructed with respect to international standards. Such dictionaries are characterized by a complex structure and an important access time when using a querying system. However, the need of a user is generally limited to a part of such a dictionary according to his domain and expertise level which corresponds to a specialized dictionary. Given the importance of managing a unified dictionary and considering the personalized needs of users, we propose an approach for generating personalized views starting from a normalized dictionary with respect to Lexical Markup Framework {LMF}-{ISO} 24613 norm. This approach provides the re-use of already defined views for a community of users by managing their profiles information and promoting the materialization of the generated views. It is composed of four main steps: (i) the projection of data categories controlled by a set of constraints (related to the user's profiles), (ii) the selection of values with consistency checking, (iii) the automatic generation of the query's model and finally, (iv) the refinement of the view. The proposed approach was consolidated by carrying out an experiment on an {LMF} normalized Arabic dictionary.},

Martin gives a rapid introduction to {NoSQL} databases: where they came from, the nature of the data models they use, and the different way you have to think about consistency. From this he outlines what kinds of circumstances you should consider using them, why they will not make relational databases obsolete, and the important consequence of polyglot persistence.},

	abstract = {{ISO} Technical Committee 37, Terminology and other language and content resources established an {ISO} 12620:2009 based Data Category Registry ({DCR}), called {ISOcat} (see http://www.isocat.org), to foster semantic interoperability of linguistic resources. This registry follows a grass roots approach, which means that any linguist can add the data categories (s)he needs. Standardized subsets of these data categories are created by a standardization procedure involving groups of international experts who are members of various Thematic Domain Groups ({TDGs}) and of the {DCR} Board. However, the goal of improving semantic interoperability can only be met if the data categories are reused by a wide variety of linguistic resource types. A resource indicates its usage of data categories by linking to them. {ISO} 12620:2009 specifies a small {DC} Reference {XML} vocabulary to annotate {XML} documents with links to data categories. The link is established by an {URI}, which servers as the Persistent {IDentifier} ({PID}) of a data category. Any {XML} document can now refer to data categories to explicate the semantics of elements, attributes and values. This paper discusses the efforts to mimic the same approach for {RDF}-based resources. It also introduces the {RDF} quad store based Relation Registry {RELcat}, which enables ontological relationships between data categories not supported by {ISOcat} and thus adds an extra level of linguistic knowledge.},

We propose to distinguish strictly between a base digitization and separate interpretation of the sources. The base digitization only includes a literal electronic transcript of the source. All sources are thus simply treated as strings of characters, i.e. as unstructured corpora. The often complex structure as found in many dictionaries and grammars will subsequently (and possibly much later) be added as Linked Data in the form of standoff annotation. A further advantage of this approach is that the complete digitization and interpretation can be performed collaboratively without a complex organizational superstructure. 1},

	url = {http://www.tagmatica.fr/lmf/HayashiLREC2008.pdf},
	abstract = {This paper discusses ontologization of lexicon access functions in the context of a service-oriented language infrastructure, such as the
Language Grid. In such a language infrastructure, an access function to a lexical resource, embodied as an atomic Web service, plays a
crucially important role in composing a composite Web service tailored to a user’s specific requirement. To facilitate the composition
process involving service discovery, planning and invocation, the language infrastructure should be ontology-based; hence the
ontologization of a range of lexicon functions is highly required. In a service-oriented environment, lexical resources however can be
classified from a service-oriented perspective rather than from a lexicographically motivated standard. Hence to address the issue of
interoperability, the taxonomy for lexical resources should be ground to principled and shared lexicon ontology. To do this, we have
ontologized the standardized lexicon modeling framework {LMF}, and utilized it as a foundation to stipulate the service-oriented lexicon
taxonomy and the corresponding ontology for lexicon access functions. This paper also examines a possible solution to fill the gap
between the ontological descriptions and the actual Web service {API} by adopting a W3C recommendation {SAWSDL}, with which Web
service descriptions can be linked with the domain ontology.},

	abstract = {Only a limited number of studies have focused on guiding students' reflection in the context of inquiry learning in science education. In this study, a review of literature about reflection, reflection skills, and reflection levels was conducted in order to develop a new model for guided reflection in the context of science education using the advantages of technology-enhanced learning. The outcomes of the literature review suggest that in the context of science education reflection should be seen as a metacognitive activity that supports the integration of theory and one's own experiences to learn from experience. It contains active reviewing and conceptualization of regulative and inquiry activities. The main activities of reflection in this context are describing, justifying, evaluating, and discussing. According to the theoretical model, describing can be guided by writing a diary or narrative, justifying by explanation guidance, or evaluating and discussing by role play. Guiding questions can be applied in supporting all activities of reflection.},

Such multilingual users may serve an important function in diffusing information across different language editions of the project, and prior work has suggested this could reduce the level of self-focus bias in each edition. This study finds multilingual users are much more active than their single-edition (monolingual) counterparts. They are found in all language editions, but smaller-sized editions with fewer users have a higher percentage of multilingual users than larger-sized editions. About a quarter of multilingual users always edit the same articles in multiple languages, while just over 40\% of multilingual users edit different articles in different languages. When non-English users do edit a second language edition, that edition is most frequently English. Nonetheless, several regional and linguistic cross-editing patterns are also present.},

	abstract = {The paper presents the Meaning-Text linguistic theory, a theoretical framework for the construction of models of natural languages, called Meaning-Text Models. Since its beginnings, in the 1960’s, the Meaning-Text theory has placed strong emphasis on semantics and considered natural language primarily as a tool for expressing meaning. This basic insight underlies its interest in linguistic synthesis (rather than analysis), paraphrase (synonymy of linguistic expressions, in particular of full sentences) and the lexicon. The Meaning-Text theory has always considered relations (rather than classes) to be the main organizing factor in language and has made an extensive use of the concept of linguistic dependency, in particular of syntactic dependency (vs. constituency). Thus, it has in many ways anticipated current developments in linguistics. Due to a formal character of the Meaning-Text theory and the corresponding models, the latter have been successfully applied in Natural Language Processing, in particular automatic text generation and machine translation. The paper is organized in five sections: 1. Natural language viewed as a Meaning-Text correspondence (postulates of the theory); 2. Meaning-Text Models of natural languages (characteristics of the models: levels of linguistic representation and rules which establish correspondences between them); 3.},

To demonstrate this, we have automatically transduced several different annotations of the Wall Street Journal corpus into {GrAF} and show how the annotations can then be merged, analyzed, and visualized using standard graph algorithms and tools. We also discuss how, as a standard graph representation, it allows for the application of well-established graph traversal and analysis algorithms to produce information about interactions and commonalities among merged annotations. {GrAF} is an extension of the Linguistic Annotation Framework ({LAF}) (Ide and Romary, 2004, 2006) developed within {ISO} {TC}37 {SC}4 and as such, implements state-of-the-art best practice guidelines for representing linguistic annotations. 1},

The most important features of this methodology are (1) the distinction of the abstract and concrete syntax of an annotation language; (2) the specification of a formal semantics for the abstract syntax; and (3) the and concrete syntax, which guarantees that any concrete syntax inherits the semantics of the abstract syntax, and thus guarantees meaning-preserving mappings between representation formats. By way of illustration, we apply this mapping strategy to annotations from {ISO}-{TimeML}, {PropBank}, and {FrameNet}.},

	abstract = {This {PhD} dissertation presents a general and formal theory of meaning, signs, and language. The theory is presented in a clear and consistent way offering novel and provocative insights into the fundamental structures and processes of communication, cognition, and reality.
Key topics include distinctions and categories, the self-contradictory dualism of word vs. object, linguistic meaning monism, relations and processes in the semiotic triangle, conceptual prototypicality and fuzziness, semantic fields and frames, meaning medium vs. forms, as well as activation and co-activation of meanings.
In order to illustrate and apply the theory, everyday examples, in particular power and law, are discussed throughout the dissertation. Methodological questions of data collection and analysis are also addressed as they are relevant to the empirical application and verification of the theory.
The dissertation combines approaches from systems theory, non-dualism, prototype theory, semantic field theory, speech act theory, and structuralism. Due to its broad and interdisciplinary focus, this dissertation will not only appeal to semioticians, philosophers, and sociologists, but also to linguists, cultural anthropologists, and cognitive scientists.},

	abstract = {The cognitive and language sciences are increasingly oriented towards the social dimension of human cognition and communication. The hitherto dominant approach in modern cognitive science has viewed social cognition through the prism of the traditional philosophical puzzle of how individuals solve the problem of understanding Other Minds. "The Shared Mind" challenges the conventional theory of mind approach, proposing that the human mind is fundamentally based on "intersubjectivity" the sharing of affective, conative, intentional and cognitive states and processes between a plurality of subjects. The socially shared, intersubjective foundation of the human mind is manifest in the structure of early interaction and communication, imitation, gestural communication and the normative and argumentative nature of language. In this path breaking volume, leading researchers from psychology, linguistics, philosophy and primatology offer complementary perspectives on the role of intersubjectivity in the context of human development, comparative cognition and evolution, and language and linguistic theory.},

	isbn = {978-0-387-95241-3},
	abstract = {Algebraic graph theory is a fascinating subject concerned with the interplay between algebra and graph theory. Algebraic tools can be used to give surprising and elegant proofs of graph theoretic facts, and there are many interesting algebraic objects associated with graphs. The authors take an inclusive view of the subject, and present a wide range of topics. These range from standard classics, such as the characterization of line graphs by eigenvalues, to more unusual areas such as geometric embeddings of graphs and the study of graph homomorphisms. The authors' goal has been to present each topic in a self-contained fashion, presenting the main tools and ideas, with an emphasis on their use in understanding concrete examples. A substantial proportion of the book covers topics that have not appeared in book form before, and as such it provides an accessible introduction to the research literature and to important open questions in modern algebraic graph theory. This book is primarily aimed at graduate students and researchers in graph theory, combinatorics, or discrete mathematics in general. However, all the necessary graph theory is developed from scratch, so the only pre-requisite for reading it is a first course in linear algebra and a small amount of elementary group theory. It should be accessible to motivated upper-level undergraduates. Chris Godsil is a full professor in the Department of Combinatorics and Optimization at the University of Waterloo. His main research interests lie in the interactions between algebra and combinatorics, in particular the application of algebraic techniques to graphs, designs and codes. He has published more than 70 papers in these areas, is a founding editor of "The Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics" and is the author of the book "Algebraic Combinatorics". Gordon Royle teaches in the Department of Computer Science \& Software Engineering at the University of Western Australia. His main research interests lie in the application of computers to combinatorial problems, in particular the cataloguing, enumeration and investigation of graphs, designs and finite geometries. He has published more than 30 papers in graph theory, design theory and finite geometry.},

	abstract = {For almost 14 years in the Language Engineering Group we have worked on a wide variety of Natural Language Processing ({NLP}) problems, being one of the earliest in the creation and operation of onomasiological dictionaries. During that time we have focused on search engine dictionary improvement, but recently our aim has been a development methodology for creating specialized onomasiological dictionaries in a semi-automatic way. To automate the creation of onomasiological dictionaries necessarily implies the automatic execution of used processes to populate the dictionaries knowledge base. Due to the nature of these dictionaries, the definitions that must be included in the knowledge base are both normative and colloquial. In this paper we present a proposal for semi-automatically populating the knowledge base of these dictionaries. 1},

Lexicographers produce dictionaries and their work consists in presenting information essential for grasping the meaning of words. However, when people need to find a word it is likely that they do not obtain the information they are looking for. There is a gap between dictionary definitions and the information being available in peoples ’ mind. This paper attempts to present the conceptualisation people engage in, in order to arrive at a word from its meaning. The insights of an experiment conducted show us the differences between the knowledge available in peoples ’ minds and in dictionary definitions. 1},

Since then, we have used both {DanNet} and dictionary data in an ongoing project to create a conceptual dictionary – a thesaurus – for Danish. In this article we will show how the thesaurus data help us overcome the major problems connected with the direct use of wordnet data in a dictionary for human users.

	abstract = {This study reports on the results of classroom research investigating the effects of corpus use in the process of revising compositions in English as a foreign language. Our primary aim was to investigate the relationship between the information extracted from corpus data and how that information actually helped in revising different types of errors in the essays. In ‘data-driven learning’, previous research has often failed to provide rigorous criteria for choosing the words or phrases suitable for correction with corpus data. By investigating the above relationship, this study aims to clarify what should be corrected by looking at corpus data. 93 undergraduate students from two universities in Tokyo wrote a short essay in 20 minutes without a dictionary, and the instructors gave coded error feedback for two lexical or grammatical errors. They deliberately selected one error which should be appropriate for checking against corpus data and one that was more likely to be corrected without using any reference resource. Three weeks later, a short hands-on instruction of the corpus query tool was given, followed by revision activities in which the participants were instructed to revise their first drafts, with or without the tool depending on the codes given to each error. 188 errors were automatically classified into three different categories (omission, addition and misformation) using natural language processing techniques. All words and phrases tagged for errors were further annotated for part-of-speech ({POS}) information. The results show that there was a significant difference in the accuracy rate among the three error types when the students consulted the corpus: omission and addition errors were easily identified and corrected, whereas misformation errors were low in correction accuracy. This reveals that certain errors are more suitable for checking against corpus data than others.},

Specifically, it examines whether corpus-informed grammar instruction is more effective through inductive, data-driven learning or through traditional deductive instruction. In the study, 49 participants completed two weeks of {ESL} grammar instruction on the passive voice in English. The learners participated in one of three instructional treatments: a data-driven learning treatment, a deductive instructional treatment using corpus-informed teaching materials, and a deductive instructional treatment using traditional (i.e., non-corpus-informed) materials. Results from pre-test, post-test, and delayed post-test indicated that the {DDL} group significantly improved their grammar ability with the passive voice, while the other two treatment groups did not show significant gains. The findings from this study suggest that in this learning context there are measurable benefits to teaching {ESL} grammar inductively using paper-based {DDL}.},

This study explores the potential of a local learner corpus by investigating the effects of two types of {DDL} activities, one relying on a native-speaker corpus ({NSC}) and the second combining native-speaker and learner corpora. Both types of activities aimed at improving second language writers’ knowledge of linking adverbials and were based on a preliminary analysis of adverbial use in the local learner corpus produced by 31 study participants. Quantitative and qualitative data, obtained from writing samples, pre/post-tests, and questionnaires, were converged through concurrent triangulation. The results showed an increase in frequency, diversity and accuracy in all participants’ use of adverbials, but more significant improvement was made by the students who were exposed to the corpus containing their own writing. The findings of this study are thus interpreted as suggestive that combining learner and native-speaker data is a feasible and effective practice, which can be readily integrated in {DDL}-based instruction with positive impact.},

	abstract = {Corpus linguistics has established that language is highly patterned. The use of patterned language has been linked to processing advantages with respect to listening and reading, which has implications for perceptions of fluency. The last twenty years has seen an increase in the integration of corpus-based language learning, or data-driven learning ({DDL}), as a supporting feature in teaching English as a foreign / second language ({EFL}/{ESL}). Most research has investigated student attitudes towards {DDL} as a tool to facilitate writing. Other studies, though notably fewer, have taken a quantitative perspective of the efficacy of {DDL} as a tool to facilitate the inductive learning of grammar rules. The purpose of this study is three-fold: (1) to present an {EFL} curriculum designed around {DDL} with the aim of improving spoken fluency; (2) to gauge how effective students were in employing newly discovered phrases in an appropriate manner; and (3) to investigate student attitudes toward such an approach to language learning. Student attitudes were investigated via a questionnaire and then triangulated through interviews and student logs. The findings indicate that students believe {DDL} to be a useful and effective tool in the classroom. However, students do note some difficulties related to {DDL}, such as encountering unfamiliar vocabulary and cut-off concordance lines. Finally, questions are raised as to the students’ ability to embed learned phrases in a pragmatically appropriate way.},

Bush expresses his concern for the direction of scientific efforts toward destruction, rather than understanding, and explicates a desire for a sort of collective memory machine with his concept of the memex that would make knowledge more accessible, believing that it would help fix these problems. Through this machine, Bush hoped to transform an information explosion into a knowledge explosion.[1]},

	abstract = {The paper describes a teacher-training course on the use of corpora in language education offered to graduate students at the Institute of Applied Linguistics, University of Warsaw. It also presents the results of two questionnaires distributed to the students prior to and after the second edition of the course. The main aims of the course are: to introduce students to the concept of a corpus and its analysis; to familiarize them with a range of available corpora, corpus-based resources and tools; and to demonstrate to them various applications of corpora in language education, with special emphasis placed on the in-house preparation of courses, teaching materials and class activities. In the first part of the paper, the design, the syllabus, the progression and the outcomes of the course are outlined. In the second part, the responses of thirteen students who participated in the second edition of the course are analysed. The analysis indicates that on the whole the students reacted positively to the course and they saw the benefits of corpus-based materials and tools in language teaching. Yet the students also reported that they needed more time to gain full command of the resources and software presented and more guidance on the pedagogical issues related to corpus use. The paper concludes that fourteen sessions, designed as an overview of the whole range of corpus-based resources and applications, is not sufficient to encourage teacher trainees to use corpora in their future work if they have no contact with these resources and tools in other classes. Only extensive exposure to corpora by future teachers coupled with suitable teacher training in the applications of corpora in language education may bring a substantial change in the scope of corpus use in language classrooms in the wide educational context.},

Since previous studies have mainly focused on corpus use in classroom settings, more research is needed to reveal how students react to using corpora on their own and what should be provided to help them become autonomous corpus users, considering that their ultimate goal is to be independent scholars and writers. In the present study, conducted in an engineering lab at a Korean university over 22 weeks, data on students’ experiences and evaluations of consulting general and specialized corpora for academic writing were collected and analyzed. The findings show that, while both corpora served the participants well as reference sources, the specialized corpus was particularly valued for its direct help in academic writing because, as non-native English-speaking graduate engineering students, the participants wanted to follow the writing conventions of their discourse community. The participants also showed disparate attitudes toward the time taken for corpus consultation due to differences in factors such as academic experience, search purposes, and writing tasks. The article concludes with several suggestions for better corpus use with {EAP} students regarding the compilation of a corpus, corpus training, corpus competence, and academic writing.},

The use of patterned language has been linked to processing advantages with respect to listening and reading, which has implications for perceptions of fluency. The last twenty years has seen an increase in the integration of corpus-based language learning, or data-driven learning ({DDL}), as a supporting feature in teaching English as a foreign / second language ({EFL}/{ESL}). Most research has investigated student attitudes towards {DDL} as a tool to facilitate writing. Other studies, though notably fewer, have taken a quantitative perspective of the efficacy of {DDL} as a tool to facilitate the inductive learning of grammar rules. The purpose of this study is three-fold: (1) to present an {EFL} curriculum designed around {DDL} with the aim of improving spoken fluency; (2) to gauge how effective students were in employing newly discovered phrases in an appropriate manner; and (3) to investigate student attitudes toward such an approach to language learning. Student attitudes were investigated via a questionnaire and then triangulated through interviews and student logs. The findings indicate that students believe {DDL} to be a useful and effective tool in the classroom. However, students do note some difficulties related to {DDL}, such as encountering unfamiliar vocabulary and cut-off concordance lines. Finally, questions are raised as to the students’ ability to embed learned phrases in a pragmatically appropriate way.},

A topic-based corpus was compiled to develop concordance learning activities, and 40 Chinese students majoring in English were randomly assigned to a control group or an experimental group. At the prewriting stage, both groups were given a list of five abstract nouns: the experimental group was provided with paper-based concordance lines to study the collocations of the words, while the control group was allowed to consult dictionaries for the usage of the words. The written texts of the pre-test, immediate post-test, and delayed post-test were analysed and compared between and within groups. The results showed that the written output by the experimental group, as compared with the control group, contained a higher variety of collocational and colligational patterns and had fewer linguistic errors in using the target abstract nouns. The post-experiment learning journals and questionnaires administered to the experimental group further confirmed that concordance activities encouraged usage-based learning, helped students notice the lexical collocations and prepositional colligations of the target words, and thus improved accuracy and complexity in their productive language. Despite these positive findings, potential problems of using concordance activities for independent learning were also reflected in the students’ written output and reported in the learning journals.},

	abstract = {This study reports on the results of classroom research investigating the effects of corpus use in the process of revising compositions in English as a foreign language. Our primary aim was to investigate the relationship between the information extracted from corpus data and how that information actually helped in revising different types of errors in the essays. In ‘data-driven learning’, previous research has often failed to provide rigorous criteria for choosing the words or phrases suitable for correction with corpus data. By investigating the above relationship, this study aims to clarify what should be corrected by looking at corpus data. 93 undergraduate students from two universities in Tokyo wrote a short essay in 20 minutes without a dictionary, and the instructors gave coded error feedback for two lexical or grammatical errors. They deliberately selected one error which should be appropriate for checking against corpus data and one that was more likely to be corrected without using any reference resource. Three weeks later, a short hands-on instruction of the corpus query tool was given, followed by revision activities in which the participants were instructed to revise their first drafts, with or without the tool depending on the codes given to each error. 188 errors were automatically classified into three different categories (omission, addition and misformation) using natural language processing techniques. All words and phrases tagged for errors were further annotated for part-of-speech ({POS}) information. The results show that there was a significant difference in the accuracy rate among the three error types when the students consulted the corpus: omission and addition errors were easily identified and corrected, whereas misformation errors were low in correction accuracy. This reveals that certain errors are more suitable for checking against corpus data than others.},

The present study reports on an experiment with secondary school students carried out to test the usefulness of separate corpus examples for comprehension and production. The results support the need for different types of examples for comprehension and production, and provide evidence in support of data-driven learning, particularly if learners have access to more than one example.},

	abstract = {Asynchronous Sequential Machine Design and Analysis provides a lucid, in-depth treatment of asynchronous state machine design and analysis presented in two parts: Part I on the background fundamentals related to asynchronous sequential logic circuits generally, and Part {II} on self-timed systems, high-performance asynchronous programmable sequencers, and arbiters. Part I provides a detailed review of the background fundamentals for the design and analysis of asynchronous finite state machines ({FSMs}). Included are the basic models, use of fully documented state diagrams, and the design and characteristics of basic memory cells and Muller C-elements. Simple {FSMs} using C-elements illustrate the design process. The detection and elimination of timing defects in asynchronous {FSMs} are covered in detail. This is followed by the array algebraic approach to the design of single-transition-time machines and use of {CAD} software for that purpose, one-hot asynchronous {FSMs}, and pulse mode {FSMs}. Part I concludes with the analysis procedures for asynchronous state machines. Part {II} is concerned mainly with self-timed systems, programmable sequencers, and arbiters. It begins with a detailed treatment of externally asynchronous/internally clocked (or pausable) systems that are delay-insensitive and metastability-hardened. This is followed by defect-free cascadable asynchronous sequencers, and defect-free one-hot asynchronous programmable sequencers--their characteristics, design, and applications. Part {II} concludes with arbiter modules of various types, those with and without metastability protection, together with applications. Presented in the appendices are brief reviews covering mixed-logic gate symbology, Boolean algebra, and entered-variable K-map minimization. End-of-chapter problems and a glossary of terms, expressions, and abbreviations contribute to the reader's learning experience. Five productivity tools are made available specifically for use with this text and briefly discussed in this front matter.},

There are two strong reasons why this has occurred. First the models are very rich in mathematical structure and hence can form the theoretical basis for use in a wide range of applications. Sec-ond the models, when applied properly, work very well in practice for several important applications. In this paper we attempt to care-fully and methodically review the theoretical aspects of this type of statistical modeling and show how they have been applied to selected problems in machine recognition of speech.},

Alan Kay, the personal computer pioneer, humanitarian and philosopher, broke that tradition last week and, instead, asked graduating students what perspective their college education had given them on humanity and what one piece of advice they would give the human race.

It was a provocative ten-minute speech, and well worth watching!

The approach is thus strongly interdisciplinary, with emphasis on formal semantic models and computational reasoning.It is worth underlying that the current reviewer is a linguist, whereas the point of view assumed by the Authors belongs to the framework of computer sciences in general and more specifically to computational linguistics.

In our scheme, there are 63 such syntactico–semantic relations. We have verified the scheme by tagging a corpus of 4167 Bangla sentences to create a treebank ({KGPBenTreebank}).},

In some cases, particularly for some ethnic languages, even unannotated corpora are still in the process of collection. We show how multilingual lexicons with under-resourced languages can be constructed using simple bilingual translation lists, which are more readily available. The prototype multilingual lexicon developed comprise six member languages: English, Malay, Chinese, French, Thai and Iban, the last of which is an under-resourced language in Borneo. Quick evaluations showed that 91.2 \% of 500 random multilingual entries in the generated lexicon require minimal or no human correction.},

In particular, a parallel is drawn with the related domain of automatic punctuation generation and a set of syntactic features derived from a deep parse tree is further proposed and successfully used in a Czech dialogue act recognition system based on conditional random fields. We finally discuss the possible reasons why so few works have exploited this type of information before and propose future research directions to further progress in this area.},

The morphological analyses of the treebank have been assigned using a novel machine learning method to disambiguate readings given by an existing tool. As the second main contribution, we present the first open source Finnish dependency parser, trained on the newly introduced treebank. The parser achieves a labeled attachment score of 81 \%.

I discuss these theories in terms of two fundamentally different development styles, the "cathedral" model of most of the commercial world versus the "bazaar" model of the Linux world. I show that these models derive from opposing assumptions about the nature of the software-debugging task. I then make a sustained argument from the Linux experience for the proposition that "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow", suggest productive analogies with other self-correcting systems of selfish agents, and conclude with some exploration of the implications of this insight for the future of software.},

In this article, we give a comparative overview of these resources and we explain the specific nature of each of them. This article provides answers to a number of question, including: What are these linguistic resources? What is the difference between them? Why were they originally created and why was the data released publicly? What can they be used for and what are the limitations of their usability? What are the text types, subject domains and languages covered? How to avoid overlapping document sets? How do they compare regarding the formatting and the translation alignment? What are their usage conditions? What other types of multilingual linguistic resources does the {EU} have? This article thus aims to clarify what the similarities and differences between the various resources are and what they can be used for. It will also serve as a reference publication for those resources, for which a more detailed description has been lacking so far ({EAC}-{TM}, {ECDC}-{TM} and {DGT}-Acquis).},

We use examples to demonstrate what the corpus can show us regarding Arabic words and phrases and how this can support lexicography and inform linguistic research.

The article also presents the ‘sketch grammar’ (the basis for the word sketches) in detail, describes the process of building and processing the corpus, and considers the role of the corpus in additional research on Arabic.},

	abstract = {The explosion of information technology has led to substantial growth of web-accessible linguistic data in terms of quantity, diversity and complexity. These resources become even more useful when interlinked with each other to generate network effects. The general trend of providing data online is thus accompanied by newly developing methodologies to interconnect linguistic data and metadata. This includes linguistic data collections, general-purpose knowledge bases (e.g., the {DBpedia}, a machine-readable edition of the Wikipedia), and repositories with specific information about languages, linguistic categories and phenomena. The Linked Data paradigm provides a framework for interoperability and access management, and thereby allows to integrate information from such a diverse set of resources. The contributions assembled in this volume illustrate the band-width of applications of the Linked Data paradigm for representative types of language resources. They cover lexical-semantic resources, annotated corpora, typological databases as well as terminology and metadata repositories. The book includes representative applications from diverse fields, ranging from academic linguistics (e.g., typology and corpus linguistics) over applied linguistics (e.g., lexicography and translation studies) to technical applications (in computational linguistics, Natural Language Processing and information technology). This volume accompanies the Workshop on Linked Data in Linguistics 2012 ({LDL}-2012) in Frankfurt/M., Germany, organized by the Open Linguistics Working Group ({OWLG}) of the Open Knowledge Foundation ({OKFN}). It assembles contributions of the workshop participants and, beyond this, it summarizes initial steps in the formation of a Linked Open Data cloud of linguistic resources, the Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud ({LLOD}).},

This book specifically analyzes the need to create, relate, and integrate the models required for an infrastructure by elaborating on the problem of accessing these models in an efficient manner via interoperable services and components. Terminological Ontologies: Design, Management and Practical Applications is geared toward information management systems and semantic web professionals working as project managers, application developers, government workers and more.

	abstract = {This paper describes the deployment of the Greek {DBpedia} and the contribution to the {DBpedia} information extraction framework with regard to internationalization (I18n) and multilingual support. I18n filters are proposed as pluggable components in order to address issues when extracting knowledge from non-English Wikipedia editions. We report on our strategy for supporting the International Resource Identifier ({IRI}) and introduce two new extractors to complement the I18n filters. Additionally, the paper discusses the definition of Transparent Content Negotiation ({TCN}) rules for {IRIs} to address de-referencing and {IRI} serialization problems. The aim of this research is to establish best practices (complemented by software) to allow the {DBpedia} community to easily generate, maintain and properly interlink language-specific {DBpedia} editions. Furthermore, these best practices can be applied for the publication of Linked Data in non-Latin languages in general.},

	abstract = {This paper describes representing translations in the Finnish wordnet, {FinnWordNet} ({FiWN}), and constructing the {FiWN} database. {FiWN} was created by translating all the word senses of the Princeton {WordNet} ({PWN}) into Finnish and by joining the translations with the semantic and lexical relations of {PWN} extracted into a relational (database) format. The approach naturally resulted in a translation relation between {PWN} and {FiWN}. Unlike many other multilingual wordnets, the translation relation in {FiWN} is primarily not on the level of synsets, but on the level of an individual word sense, which allows more precise translation correspondences. This can easily be projected into a synset-level translation relation, used for linking with other wordnets via Core {WordNet}. Synset-level translations are also used as a default in the absence of word sense translations. The {FiWN} data in the relational database can be converted to other formats. In the {PWN} database format, translations are attached to source-language words, allowing the implementation of a Web search interface also working as a bilingual dictionary. Another representation encodes the translation relation as a finite-state transducer.},

	abstract = {Research has increased notably in vision-based automatic sign language recognition ({ASLR}). However, there has been little attention given to building a uniform platform for these purposes. Sign language ({SL}) includes not only static hand gestures, finger spelling, hand motions (which are called manual signs “{MS}”) but also facial expressions, lip reading, and body language (which are called non-manual signs “{NMS}”). Building up a database ({DB}) that includes both {MS} and {NMS} is the main first step for any {SL} recognition task. In addition to this, the Arabic Sign Language ({ArSL}) has no standard database. For this purpose, this paper presents a {DB} developed for the {ArSL} {MS} and {NM} signs which we call {SignsWorld} Atlas. The postures, gestures, and motions included in this {DB} are collected in lighting and background laboratory conditions. Individual facial expression recognition and static hand gestures recognition tasks were tested by the authors using the {SignsWorld} Atlas, achieving a recognition rate of 97\% and 95.28\%, respectively.},

The {pH} and {PCO}2 of the control perfusate were 7.40 and 39 {mmHg}, respectively. In the rabbit septum a metabolic acidosis ({pH} equals 6.82, {PCO}2 equals 39 {mmHg}) caused a loss of 16\% of control tension in 12 min. Na+ and K+ exchange were unaltered. A comparable respiratory acidosis ({pH} equals 6.81, {PCO}2 equals 159 {mmHg}) caused a 51\% loss of tension in 2 min. Na+ exchange was unaltered but K+ efflux fell from 8.9 +/- 0.6 (mean +/- {SE}) to 4.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/kg dry wt per min (P less than 0.001, n equals 10). A net gain of K+ of 16.9 +/- 1.7 (n equals 14) mmol/kg dry wt occurred and was attributable to a delayed fall in K+ influx relative to efflux over 15 min. The net gain could not be mimicked by epinephrine administration or blocked by propranolol and was absent in the beating rat septum and the quiescent rabbit septum. These results suggest that the net uptake of K+, which appears to be dependent on a period of depolarization, and the changes of contractility are controlled by the H+ ion concentration at a cellular site whose exchange with the extracellular space is characterized by a considerable restriction of diffusion. Changes of contractility are not related to the net uptake of K+.},

However for linguistics, much data is still published in proprietary, closed formats and is not made available on the web. We propose the use of linked data principles to enable language resources to be published and interlinked openly on the web, and we describe the application of this paradigm to the modeling of two resources, {WordNet} and the {MASC} corpus. Here, {WordNet} and the {MASC} corpus serve as representative examples for two major classes of linguistic resources, lexical-semantic resources and annotated corpora, respectively.Furthermore, we argue that modeling and publishing language resources as linked data offers crucial advantages as compared to existing formalisms. In particular, it is explained how this can enhance the interoperability and the integration of linguistic resources. Further benefits of this approach include unambiguous identifiability of elements of linguistic description, the creation of dynamic, but unambiguous links between different resources, the possibility to query across distributed resources, and the availability of a mature technological infrastructure. Finally, recent community activities are described.},

	abstract = {In the context of the emergent Web of Data, a large number of organizations, institutes and companies (e.g., {DBpedia}, Data.gov, {GeoNames}, {PubMed}) adopt the Linked Data practices. Utilizing the Semantic Web ({SW}) technologies, they publish their data and offer {SPARQL} endpoints (i.e., {SPARQL}-based search services). On the other hand, the dominant standard for information exchange in the Web today is {XML}. Additionally, many international standards (e.g., Dublin Core, {MPEG}-7, {METS}, {TEI}, {IEEE} {LOM}) in several domains (e.g., Digital Libraries, {GIS}, Multimedia, e-Learning) have been expressed in {XML} Schema. The aforementioned have led to an increasing emphasis on {XML} data, accessed using the {XQuery} query language. The {SW} and {XML} worlds and their developed infrastructures are based on different data models, semantics and query languages. Thus, it is crucial to develop interoperability mechanisms that allow the Web of Data users to access {XML} datasets, using {SPARQL}, from their own working environments. It is unrealistic to expect that all the existing legacy data (e.g., Relational, {XML}, etc.) will be transformed into {SW} data. Therefore, publishing legacy data as Linked Data and providing {SPARQL} endpoints over them has become a major research challenge. In this direction, we introduce the {SPARQL}2XQuery Framework which creates an interoperable environment, where {SPARQL} queries are automatically translated to {XQuery} queries, in order to access {XML} data across the Web. The {SPARQL}2XQuery Framework provides a mapping model for the expression of {OWL}–{RDF}/S to {XML} Schema mappings as well as a method for {SPARQL} to {XQuery} translation. To this end, our Framework supports both manual and automatic mapping specification between ontologies and {XML} Schemas. In the automatic mapping specification scenario, the {SPARQL}2XQuery exploits the {XS}2OWL component which transforms {XML} Schemas into {OWL} ontologies. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted in order to evaluate the schema transformation, mapping generation, query translation and query evaluation efficiency, using both real and synthetic datasets.},

On the other hand, the dominant standard for information exchange in the Web today is {XML}. Many international standards (e.g., Dublin Core, {MPEG}-7,{METS}, {TEI}, {IEEE} {LOM},etc.) have been expressed in {XML} Schema resulting to a large number of {XML} datasets. The {SW} and {XML} worlds and their developed infrastructures are based on different data models, semantics and query languages. Thus, it is crucial to provide interoperability and integration mechanisms to bridge the gap between the {SW} and {XML} worlds. In this chapter, we give an overview and a comparison of the technologies and the standards adopted by the {XML} and {SW} worlds. In addition, we outline the latest efforts from the W3C groups, including the latest working drafts and recommendations (e.g., {OWL} 2, {SPARQL} 1.1, {XML} Schema 1.1, etc.). Moreover, we present a survey of the research approaches which aim to provide interoperability and integration between the {XML} and {SW} worlds. Finally, we present the {SPARQL}2XQuery and {XS}2OWL Frameworks, which bridge the gap and create an interoperable environment between the two worlds. These Frameworks provide mechanisms for: (a) Query translation ({SPARQL} to {XQuery} translation); (b) Mapping specification and generation (Ontology to {XML} Schema mapping); and (c) Schema transformation ({XML} Schema to {OWL} transformation).},

	abstract = {The dominant standards in multimedia content and service description, namely the {MPEG}-7 and the {MPEG}-21, have been expressed in {XML} Schema syntax. In addition, ontologies that capture the semantics of these standards have been developed using the semantic web languages. Since different communities in the industry and the academia work and are familiar with the Semantic Web environment or the {XML} environment, a Schema mapping framework and a Query mapping framework are needed that will allow querying multimedia content and service descriptions in a uniform way in both the {XML} and Semantic Web environments. We present in this paper {SPARQL}2XQuery 2.0, a framework that allows expressing semantic queries on top of {XML} data through the translation of {SPARQL} queries in {XQuery} syntax. {SPARQL}2XQuery 2.0 may work with both existing ontologies and with automatically produced ones, formed according to our {XS}2-{OWL} 2.0 transformation model. {XS}2-{OWL} 2.0 exploits the {OWL} 2.0 semantics and supports the new {XML} constructs introduced by {XML} Schema 1.1.},

In this paper, we present two experiments that use on-line measures to test the prediction that semantic context shapes readers' expectations about the past-tense form of an upcoming verb. Consistent with the predictions of “single-route” accounts that model inflection using a uniform process of comparison to stored forms in memory, and contrary to the predictions of theories that posit context-independent rules, semantics are found to strongly influence reaction time data for both irregular and regular verbs, and for both existing and nonce verb forms. At the same time, no dissociation between regular and irregulars is observed, a finding which undercuts “dual-route” arguments for a grammatical constraint on denominal verb inflection. We discuss how these results may be understood in terms of discrimination learning.},

By defining abstractions over the corpus data, we can generalise from a large set of individual corpus annotations, thereby inducing a lexicon model.  The resulting combined corpus and lexicon model can be interpreted as a graph structure that offers flexible querying functionality beyond current {XML}-based query languages. Its powerful methods for characterising and checking consistency can be used for incremental model refinement. In addition, the formalisation in a graph-based structure offers the means of defining flexible lexicon views over the corpus data. These views can be tailored for linguistic inspection or to define clean interfaces with other linguistic resources.  We illustrate our approach by applying it to the syntactically and semantically annotated {SALSA}/{TIGER} corpus, a collection of German newspaper text.},

	url = {http://elanguage.net/journals/lilt/article/view/215},
	abstract = {To make sense of an utterance, people identify in its linear linguistic expression the concepts and the connections between them. A concept normally has a lexical realization; connections between concepts often do not, but they are perceived even without the benefit of lexical cues. Making these connections  called semantic relations in the field of natural language processing  relies on the form and structure of linguistic expressions, and the concepts these expressions evoke. This implies two levels: the level of the text, the linguistic expression with its form and (grammatical) structure, and the level of the concepts which the speaker wants to convey.
An overview of the literature shows that semantic relations are, for pragmatic reasons, a means to an end  extract information, explain the links between the head of a phrase and its arguments, and so on  and that is why they are analyzed from the perspective of what they link. At the text level, the process of semantic relation analysis is informed by syntactic elements  noun phrases, verbs and their arguments, clauses and so on  thus differentiating semantic relations based on the complexity of the syntactic constructions in which their arguments appear. At the conceptual level, the same semantic relation is assigned to pairs of concepts, regardless of their surface expression. The process can be said to disregard the implications of having syntactic con- structions of various complexity correspond to the concepts linked.
In this article, we propose to put semantic relations first: analyze them, deter- mine what constraints they place on the concepts they connect, and how those concepts can be lexicalized. Lexicalization takes place via expressions of in- creasing syntactic complexity: phrases, clauses and multi-clause sentences. Next, we show how the linguistic phenomena involved in producing different lexicalizations explain  in a systematic manner  how semantic relations can have instances in syntactic constructions of various complexity. We focus on binary semantic relations between concepts/textual elements within sentences.
This kind of analysis leads to a better understanding of the relations themselves and to a systematic account of phenomena related to their occurrence in texts. It reveals some of the assumptions and linguistic gaps people fill when they recognize relations in text. From the computational point of view of text processing, such a solid basis of the analysis of semantic relations adds consistency. Evidence for a particular relation can come from all its instances in a text, regardless of the syntactic form of the concepts it connects. Knowledge of the expected concepts and their syntactic realization may signal the presence of covert or implied information, which we can then work to retrieve. Assigning a semantic relation should be a conscious choice, with the understanding of what implications such a tag has both for the implicitly and explicitly expressed elements of a concept.},

	abstract = {In every field of scientific enquiry, there is much data and therefore frequent cause to turn to the computer to help process it. This is certainly true of linguists. They use computers to search for examples of grammatical phenomena in large corpora and to collect statistics on their occurrence. They can use them to compile lexica, and to compare them with a view to assessing the relatedness of pairs of languages. Activities like these are collectively referred to as Natural Language Processing ({NLP}). Generally speaking, however, {NLP} is an engineering, rather than a scientific enterprise, much of it devoted to developing technologies, like machine translation, information retrieval, and speech recognition. It would be natural to expect these technological developments to be informed by the results of scientific enquiry carried out by linguists. In other words, it would be natural that they should have a foundation in computational linguistics. But this is rarely the case. Technological development in {NLP} is based almost entirely on machine-learning models most of which are wild and fantastical from a linguist’s perspective. This, of course, is an aberration which, fortunately, may be in the course of correction.  			In a tightly argued and largely convincing essay elsewhere in this volume, Steven Abney expresses a different view. “Computational linguistics”, he writes, “is not a specialization of linguistics at all, at least not if we take “linguistics” and “computational linguistics” as academic communities defined by their membership.” An academic community is a set of people and a set is surely defined by its membership, but sets do not confer on their members the right to appropriate names already long since claimed by the members of other sets. In this paper, I shall continue to use the term “Computational Linguistics” to refer to an approach to the subject of linguistics that is informed and inspired by computing.  			 			 			With Abney, I shall argue in this paper that “Language is a compu- tational system, and there is a depth of understanding that is simply unachievable without a thorough knowledge of computation.” There is a natural affinity between linguistics and computer science, and it is one that has very little to do with {NLP}. It arises because human language is one of very few naturally occurring phenomena that is fundamentally digital. Linguists and lay people alike tacitly acknowledge this affin ity when they discuss such questions as whether spider is an insect, whether the vowel in “marry” is the some as the one in “merry”, or whether I can claim simultaneously that “I heard about the argument in the library” while denying the truth of both “I was in the library” and “The argument was in the library”. Notice that, while a spider may be more or less like an insect, it cannot be more or less an insect. Either it is, or it is not. Likewise with the vowels in “marry” and “merry”. They may sound more or less different in the speech of different people, but the vowels of a particular English speaker’s language constitute a small, fixed set and, in a given dialect, the vowels in these words are instances either of the same, or different members of that set. The sentence about the argument and the library has (at least) two syntactic structures, one of which puts me, and one which puts the argument, in the library. Language places the phenomena in its purview into absolutely discrete classes, and this is what makes it a digital system.},

What should they do when most of the low hanging fruit has been pretty much picked over?  			In the particular case of Machine Translation, the revival of statistical approaches (e.g., Brown et al. (1993)) started out with finite-state methods for pragmatic reasons, but gradually over time, researchers have become more and more receptive to the use of syntax to capture long-distance dependences, especially when there isn't very much parallel corpora, and for language pairs with very different word orders (e.g., translating between a subject-verb-object ({SVO}) language like English and a verb final language like Japanese). Going forward, we should expect Machine Translation research to make more and more use of richer and richer linguistic representations. So too, there will soon be a day when stress will become important for speech recognition.  		 		 			 			Since it isn't possible for textbooks in computational linguistics to cover all of these topics, we should work with colleagues in other departments to make sure that students receive an education that is broad enough to prepare them for all possible futures, or at least all probable futures.},

The practice is well-attested in Homeric papyri, but it appears to have fallen into disuse in these texts around the 1st century {AD}.

A catchword is a word placed at the foot of a handwritten or printed page that is meant to be bound along with other pages in a book. The word anticipates the first word of the following page. It was meant to help the bookbinder or printer make sure that the leaves were bound in the right order or that the pages were set up in the press in the right order. Catchwords appear in some medieval manuscripts, and appear again in printed books late in the fifteenth century. The practice became widespread in the mid sixteenth century, and prevailed until the arrival of industrial printing techniques late in the eighteenth century.
Theodore Low Devinne's 1901 guide on Correct Composition had this to say:

For more than three centuries printers of books appended at the foot of every page the first word or syllable of the next page. This catchword was supposed to be needed by the reader to make clear the connection between the two pages ;  but the catchword is now out of use, and it is not missed.},

	abstract = {Pagination is the process of dividing (content) into discrete pages, either electronic pages or printed pages. Today the latter are usually simply instances of the former that have been output to a printing device, such as a desktop printer or a modern printing press. For example, printed books and magazines are created first as electronic files (for example, {PDF} or {QXD} files) and then printed. Pagination encompasses rules and algorithms for deciding where page breaks will fall, which depends on semantic or cultural senses of which content belongs on the same page with related content and thus should not fall to another (e.g., widows and orphans). Pagination is sometimes a part of page layout, and other times is merely a process of arbitrary fragmentation. The difference is in the degree of intelligence that is required to produce an output that the users deem acceptable or desirable. Before the rise of information technology ({IT}), pagination was a manual process, and print output was its sole purpose. Every instance of a pagination decision was made by a human. Today, most instances are made by machines, although humans often override particular decisions (such as by inserting a hard page break). As years go by, software developers continually refine the programs to increase the quality of the machine-made decisions (make them "smarter") so that the need for manual overrides becomes increasingly rare.
In reference to books made in the pre-{IT} era, in a strict sense of the word, pagination can mean the consecutive numbering to indicate the proper order of the pages, which was rarely found in documents pre-dating 1500, and only became common practice circa 1550, when it replaced foliation, which numbered only the front sides of folios.},

	abstract = {The Phoenician alphabet, called by convention the Proto-Canaanite alphabet for inscriptions older than around 1200 {BC}, is the oldest verified consonantal alphabet, or abjad. It was used for the writing of Phoenician, a Northern Semitic language, used by the civilization of Phoenicia. It is classified as an abjad because it records only consonantal sounds (matres lectionis were used for some vowels in certain late varieties).
The Phoenician alphabet is derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics  and became one of the most widely used writing systems, spread by Phoenician merchants across the Mediterranean world, where it evolved and was assimilated by many other cultures. The Paleo-Hebrew alphabet was directly derived from Phoenician. The Aramaic alphabet, a modified form of Phoenician, was the ancestor of modern Arabic script. The Modern Hebrew script is a stylistic variant of the Aramaic script. The Greek alphabet (and by extension its descendants such as the Latin, the Cyrillic, and the Coptic) was a direct successor of Phoenician, and the first full alphabet (including vowels, rather than just consonants), having evolved certain letter values to represent vowels.
As the letters were originally incised with a stylus, most of the shapes are angular and straight, although more cursive versions are increasingly attested in later times, culminating in the Neo-Punic alphabet of Roman-era North Africa. Phoenician was usually written from right to left, although there are some texts written in boustrophedon.
In 2005, {UNESCO} registered the Phoenician alphabet into the Memory of the World Programme as a heritage of Lebanon.},

	abstract = {Although number words are common in everyday speech, learning their meanings is an arduous, drawn-out process for most children, and the source of this delay has long been the subject of inquiry. Children begin by identifying the few small numerosities that can be named without counting, and this has prompted further debate over whether there is a specific, capacity-limited system for representing these small sets, or whether smaller and larger sets are both represented by the same system. Here we present a formal, computational analysis of number learning that offers a possible solution to both puzzles. This analysis indicates that once the environment and the representational demands of the task of learning to identify sets are taken into consideration, a continuous system for learning, representing and discriminating set-sizes can give rise to effective discontinuities in processing. At the same time, our simulations illustrate how typical prenominal linguistic constructions (“there are three balls”) structure information in a way that is largely unhelpful for discrimination learning, while suggesting that postnominal constructions (“balls, there are three”) will facilitate such learning. A training-experiment with three-year olds confirms these predictions, demonstrating that rapid, significant gains in numerical understanding and competence are possible given appropriately structured postnominal input. Our simulations and results reveal how discrimination learning tunes children's systems for representing small sets, and how its capacity-limits result naturally out of a mixture of the learning environment and the increasingly complex task of discriminating and representing ever-larger number sets. They also explain why children benefit so little from the training that parents and educators usually provide. Given the efficacy of our intervention, the ease with which it can be implemented, and the large body of research showing how early numerical ability predicts later educational outcomes, this simple discovery may have far-reaching consequences.},

	abstract = {Object-oriented ontology ({OOO}) is a metaphysical movement that rejects the privileging of human existence over the existence of nonhuman objects. Specifically, object-oriented ontology opposes the anthropocentrism of Immanuel Kant's Copernican Revolution, whereby objects are said to conform to the mind of the subject and, in turn, become products of human cognition. In contrast to Kant's view, object-oriented philosophers maintain that objects exist independently of human perception and are not ontologically exhausted by their relations with humans or other objects. Thus, for object-oriented ontologists, all relations, including those between nonhumans, distort their related objects in the same basic manner as human consciousness and exist on an equal footing with one another.
Object-oriented ontology is often viewed as a subset of speculative realism, a contemporary school of thought that criticizes the post-Kantian reduction of philosophical enquiry to a correlation between thought and being, such that the reality of anything outside of this correlation is unknowable. Object-oriented ontology predates speculative realism, however, and makes distinct claims about the nature and equality of object relations to which not all speculative realists agree. The term “object-oriented philosophy” was officially coined by Graham Harman, the movement's founder, in his 1999 doctoral dissertation "Tool-Being: Elements in a Theory of Objects." Since then, a number of theorists working in a variety of disciplines have adapted Harman's ideas, including philosophy professor Levi Bryant, literature and ecology scholar Timothy Morton, video game designer Ian Bogost, and medievalists Jeffrey Jerome Cohen and Eileen Joy. In 2009, Bryant rephrased Harman's original designation as “object-oriented ontology,” giving the movement its current name.},

	abstract = {This volume presents Professor Cohen's original interpretation of the revolution that marked the beginnings of modern science and set Newtonian science as the model for the highest level of achievement in other branches of science. It shows that Newton developed a special kind of relation between abstract mathematical constructs and the physical systems that we observe in the world around us by means of experiment and critical observation. The heart of the radical Newtonian style is the construction on the mind of a mathematical system that has some features in common with the physical world; this system was then modified when the deductions and conclusions drawn from it are tested against the physical universe. Using this system Newton was able to make his revolutionary innovations in celestial mechanics and, ultimately, create a new physics of central forces and the law of universal gravitation. Building on his analysis of Newton's methodology, Professor Cohen explores the fine structure of revolutionary change and scientific creativity in general. This is done by developing the concept of scientific change as a series of transformations of existing ideas. It is shown that such transformation is characteristic of many aspects of the sciences and that the concept of scientific change by transformation suggests a new way of examining the very nature of scientific creativity.},

	shorttitle = {The Last Phonological Rule},
	abstract = {Over the past three decades, phonological theory has advanced in many areas, but it has changed little in its foundational assumptions about how computational processes can serve as a basis for the theory. This volume suggests that it may be worthwhile to reconsider some of those assumptions. Is there an order to the rules in a phonological derivation? What kinds of links other than derivations are possible between the level of mental representation and the level of speech sounds? Since phonological representations are so much more sophisticated today than they were a few decads ago, do we need any phonological rules at all?  In this provocative book, leading linguists and computer scientists consider the challenges that computational innovations pose to current rule-based phonological theories and speculate about the advantages of phonological models based on artificial neural networks and other computer designs. The authors offer new conceptions of phonological theory for the 1990s, the most radical of which proposes that phonological processes cannot be characterized by rules at all, but arise from the dynamics of a system of phonological representations in a high-dimensional vector space of the sort that a neural network embodies. This new view of phonology is becoming increasingly attractive to linguists and others in the cognitive sciences because it answers some difficult questions about learning while drawing on recent results in philosophy, psychology, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience.  The contributors are John A. Goldsmith, Larry M. Hyman, George Lakoff, K. P. Mohanan, David S. Touretzky, and Deirdre W. Wheeler.},

	abstract = {Predictive text is an input technology used where one key or button represents many letters, such as on mobile phones's numeric keypads and in accessibility technologies. Each key press results in a prediction rather than repeatedly sequencing through the same group of "letters" it represents, in the same, invariable order. Predictive text could allow for an entire word to be input by single keypress. Predictive text makes efficient use of fewer device keys to input writing into a text message, an e-mail, an address book, a calendar, and the like.
The most widely used, general, predictive text systems are T9, {iTap}, and {LetterWise}/{WordWise}. There are many unique ways to build a device that predicts text, but all predictive text systems have initial, linguistic settings that offer predictions that are re-prioritized to adapt to each user. This learning adapts, by way of the device memory, to a user's disambiguating feedback that results in corrective key presses, such as pressing a "next" key to get to the intention. Most predictive text systems have a user database to facilitate this process.
Theoretically the number of keystrokes required per desired character in the finished writing is, on average, comparable to using a keyboard. This is approximately true providing that all words used are in its database, punctuation is ignored, and no input mistakes are made typing or spelling. In practice, these factors are found to cause tremendous variance in the efficiency gain. The theoretical keystrokes per character, {KSPC}, of a keyboard is {KSPC}=1.00, and of multi-tap is {KSPC}=2.03. Eatoni' {LetterWise} is a predictive multi-tap hybrid, which when operating on a standard telephone keypad achieves {KSPC}=1.15 for English.
The choice of which predictive text system is the best to use involves matching the user's preferred interface style, the user's level of learned ability to operate predictive text software, and the user's efficiency goal. There are various levels of risk in predictive text systems, versus multi-tap systems, because the predicted text that is automatically written that provide the speed and mechanical efficiency benefit, could, if the user is not careful to review, result in transmitting misinformation. Predictive text systems take time to learn to use well, and so generally, a device's system has user options to set up the choice of multi-tap or of any one of several schools of predictive text methods.},

It sets forth the network of hypotheses constituting Paradigm Function Morphology, a theory of inflectional form whose central insight is that paradigms play an essential role in the definition of a language's system of word structure. The theory comprises several unprecedented claims, chief among which is the claim that a language's realization rules serve as clauses in the definition of a paradigm function, an overarching construct which is indispensable for capturing certain kinds of generalizations about inflectional form." "This book differs from other recent works on the same subject in that it treats inflectional morphology as an autonomous system of principles rather than as a subsystem of syntax or phonology and it draws upon evidence from a diverse range of languages in motivating the proposed conception of word structure."--Jacket.},

Sellegipoolest ei ole keeleteaduses välja kujunenud ühest arusaama sellest, kui palju ja millised semantilised rollid on keele kirjeldamisel vajalikud. Käesolevas artiklis tutvustatakse olulisemat semantiliste rollidega seotud problemaatikat. Artiklis antakse ülevaade semantiliste rollide ajaloost, enamkasutatavatest semantilistest rollidest, rollide hierarhilisusest ning rolle eristavatest olulistest joontest (kontroll, mõjutatus, elusus), rollide markeerimisest ja kuhjumisest eesti keele näidete varal.Semantic roles as a linguistic tool. Semantic roles are widely used in linguistics to analyse and describe language and are most commonly understand as semantic concepts which show how participants and events are related. However, there is no general agreement about the number of semantic roles; the definitions of semantic roles vary from study to study likewise. In this paper we provide an overview of the history of semantic roles and also give a short list of main semantic roles. Our purpose is to highlight some key aspects of establishing semantic roles, such as narrow vs. wide definitions of semantic roles, the hierarchies of semantic roles, and the main features (namely, control, volitionality, and affectedness) that are related to the content of semantic roles. We also address an issue concerning expressing semantic roles, that is, how a particular semantic role may be lexicalised with different linguistic means and how semantic roles may be conflated.},

We limit ourselves to some major points of the talk, skipping all the minor details. The main hero of this note is the notion of the intended model of a theory. Some emphasis is put on the role of extremal axioms in the characterization of such models. The notion of the intended model seems to be of some interest for linguists, too. This is one of the reasons for which this paper is published in a linguistic journal.},

	abstract = {This second edition of the Handbook of Philosophical Logic reflects great changes in the landscape of philosophical logic since the first edition. It gives readers an idea of that landscape and its relation to computer science and formal language and artificial intelligence. It shows how the increased demand for philosophical logic from computer science and artificial intelligence and computational linguistics accelerated the development of the subject directly and indirectly. This development in turn, directly pushed research forward, stimulated by the needs of applications. New logic areas became established and old areas were enriched and expanded. At the same time, it socially provided employment for generations of logicians residing in computer science, linguistics and electrical engineering departments which of course helped keep the logic community to thrive. The many contributors to this Handbook are active in these application areas and are among the most famous leading figures of applied philosophical logic of our times.},

	abstract = {In mathematics, especially in the area of abstract algebra known as combinatorial group theory, the word problem for a finitely generated group G is the algorithmic problem of deciding whether two words in the generators represent the same element. More precisely, if A is a finite set of generators for G then the word problem is the membership problem for the formal language of all words in A and a formal set of inverses that map to the identity under the natural map from the free monoid with involution on A to the group G. If B is another finite generating set for G, then the word problem over the generating set B is equivalent to the word problem over the generating set A. Thus one can speak unambiguously of the decidability of the word problem for the finitely generated group G.
The related but different uniform word problem for a class K of recursively presented groups is the algorithmic problem of deciding, given as input a presentation P for a group G in the class K and two words in the generators of G, whether the words represent the same element of G. Some authors require the class K to be definable by a recursively enumerable set of presentations.},

	abstract = {Karl August Engelbrekt Ahlqvist, född 7 augusti 1826 i Kuopio, död 20 november 1889 i Helsingfors, var en finländsk språkforskare och författare.
Ahlqvist genomgick skola och gymnasium i Kuopio. Han blev student i Helsingfors 1844, tog licentiatexamen 1859, utnämndes till docent i de finska språken samma år och (efter Elias Lönnrot) till professor i samma ämne 1863. Från hembygden medförde han en säker uppfattning av sin nations hela sätt att leva, tänka och känna samt en glödande fosterlandskärlek. Finska språkets vetenskapliga utforskande och praktiska utbildning gjorde han redan såsom student till sitt levnadsmål. Första frukten av hans litterära verksamhet var några översättningar till finskan, bland annat av Johan Ludvig Runebergs "Idyll och epigram" och "Molnets broder" samt Carl Jonas Love Almquists "Kapellet" och "Grimstahamns nybygge".
År 1847 uppsatte Ahlqvist tillsammans några likasinnade studenter "Suometar", den första tidning, som på finska behandlade högre kulturfrågor. Samtidigt började han ägna sig åt språkvetenskaplig forskning. Redan 1846 och 1847 genomvandrade han östra delen av Österbotten samt finska och ryska Karelen, dels för att ur folkets mun samla kväden och sagor, dels för att undersöka munarterna; men 1854–58 tillbringade han nästan helt och hållet på forskningsresor bland de finska stammarna i Östersjöprovinserna, landskapet Olonets samt östra Ryssland och Sibirien. Under mödor och försakelser av alla slag vistades han då bland stammar, av vilka några ännu stod på jägarens kulturståndpunkt, samt återvände med en rik skörd av etnografiska och lingvistiska iakttagelser. Åren 1861 och 1862 var han i Tyskland och Ungern, likaledes i vetenskapligt syfte.
Den första frukten av dessa färder blev flera grundliga lingvistiska specialarbeten, bland annat Votisk grammatik (1855), Anteckningar i Nord-tschudiskan (= vepsiskan, 1859), Läran om verbet i Mokscha-mordwinskan (specimen för docentur, 1859) och Versuch einer Mokscha-mordwinischen Grammatik (1861), vilka är viktiga, särskilt genom den belysning de ger den jämförande finska språkforskningen. Av stor betydelse är hans De vestfinska språkens kulturord (1871), där han genom jämförande språkforskning söker belysa finnarnas äldsta kulturståndpunkt och andra folks inflytande på deras utveckling.
Även genom flitigt författande av läroböcker och genom publicistisk verksamhet arbetade Ahlqvist för den nationella bildningen, och i enlighet med sin självständiga karaktär motarbetade han med kraft de ensidigheter, som visade sig hos en del finskhetsivrare. Åren 1871–74 utgav han på finska en egen tidskrift, "Kieletär" (Språkets genius), som innehöll lingvistiska uppsatser samt litterär kritik. År 1877 utkom Suomen kielen rakennus (Finska språkets byggnad).
Åren 1877 och 1880 studerade Ahlqvist nordostjakerna och vogulerna i Sibirien, varav resultaten föreligger i flera arbeten, bland annat Über die Sprache der Nordostjaken (1880), Unter Wogulen und Ostjaken (1885) och Wogulisches Wörterverzeichnis (1891). I arbetet Kalevalan karjalaisuus (Kalevalas karelska ursprung, 1887) riktar sig han mot Julius Krohns undersökningar om Kalevalas hemort, försvarande dess härstamning från Karelen.
Ahlqvist verkade även såsom skald, även om hans produktivitet inte var stor. Hans diktsamling Säkeniä ("Gnistor"; två häften 1860 och 1868; ny upplaga 1874) är det klaraste intyget om vad han förmått verka för det finska språkets utveckling, liksom den i metriskt avseende är frukten av långvariga studier, vilkas teoretiska resultat han framlagt i sin finska metrik (Runousoppi, utgiven 1863 som specimen för professur). Som skald framträdde han under namnet "Oksanen" (en avledning från det finska ordet oksa, kvist). Han var universitetets rektor 1884–87, erhöll statsråds titel 1887 och tog avsked som professor emeritus 1888.},

The first concerns the logical approach, trying to reconstitute the itinerary from the continuous nature of phonetic reality to the discrete nature of phonological representations. This is done by Batog, by means of Lesniewski's mereology. The second direction develops Harris' ideas, considering the phoneme as a class of sonorous strings. A typical research in this respect was done by Kanger. The subsequent investigation of this model shows the surprising and delicate fact that a class of sonorous strings defining a phoneme is not an equivalence class. The third direction is related to Jakobson's way to consider a phoneme as a class of (binary) distinctive features. The graph-theoretic study of initial and final consonantic groups was initiated by Marcus–Vasiliu and further developed and/or used by Horecký, Lekomceva, Lekomcev, Piotrovskiî, Revzin, Saumjan, and Afendras. An algebraic model of phonetic segmentation was proposed by Naftanail.},

Historical lingustics seeks to find out by going beyond the history of individual languages to discover the general principles which underlie language change. But our evidence is severely limited. Most of the world's languages are still unwritten, and even in areas with long written traditions, such as Europe and the Near East, documentary evidence stretches only a little way back along the path of the historical development of languages.How, then, can we uncover our long linguistic prehistory, and what can it tell us about language change? This new textbook is an accessible general guide for students with an elementary knowledge of linguistics to the methods and theoretical bases of linguistic reconstruction, and of newer, less well established principles such as the application of linguistic universals and language typology, and quantitative techniques. Finally he reviews the principles for establishing language relationships and for uncovering information about the homelands and cultures of the prehistoric speakers of reconstructed languages.},

	title = {On the pragmatic and semantic functions of Estonian sentence prosody},
	url = {https://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/18943/},
	abstract = {The goal of the dissertation was to investigate intonational correlates of information structure in a free word order language, Estonian. Information-structural categories such as focus or givenness are expressed by different grammatical means (e.g. pronoun, presence of accent, word order etc.) in different languages of the world (Chafe, 1976; 1987; Prince, 1981; 1992; Lambrecht, 1994; Gundel, 1999). The main cue of focus in intonation languages (e.g. English and German) is pitch accent (Halliday, 1967a; Ladd, 2008). In free word order languages, information structure affects the position of words in a sentence (É. Kiss, 1995) and sometimes it is even implied that word order in a free word order language might function like pitch accent in an intonation language (Lambrecht 1994: 240). The study reports on perception and production experiments on the effects of focus and givenness on Estonian sentence intonation. The aim of the experiments was to establish whether information structure has tonal correlates in Estonian, and if so, whether information structure or word order interacts more strongly with sentence intonation.
A perception experiment showed that L1-Estonian listeners perceive pitch prominence as focus and accent shift as a change of sentence focus. A speech production study showed congruently that L1-Estonian speakers do use accent shift, and mark sentence focus with pitch accent. Another speech production experiment demonstrated that there is no phonetic difference between new information focus (e.g. “What did Lena draw?” – “Lena drew a whale.”) and corrective focus (e.g. “Lena drew a lion.” – “No! She drew a whale”). The last experiment showed that given information is signalled with varying F0 range, if followed by focus, but without a pitch accent, if preceded by focus.
All the experiments revealed that word order has a weak influence on sentence intonation. Sentence intonation interacts with focus and givenness in Estonian. As a conclusion, it is suggested that the pragmatic functions of word order, which apparently can be overridden by focus interpretation, are slightly different from the functions of pitch accent.},

	abstract = {Most ideas come from previous ideas. The sixties, particularly in the {ARPA} community, gave rise to a host of notions about “human-computer symbiosis” through interactive time-shared computers, graphics screens and pointing devices. Advanced computer languages were invented to simulate complex systems such as oil refineries and semi-intelligent behavior. The soon to follow paradigm shift of modern personal computing, overlapping window interfaces, and object-oriented design came from seeing the work of the sixties as something more than a “better old thing”. That is, more than a better way: to do mainframe computing; for end-users to invoke functionality; to make data structures more abstract. Instead the promise of exponential growth in computing/\$/volume   demanded that the sixties be regarded as “almost a new thing” and to find out what the actual “new things” might be. For example, one would compute with a handheld “Dynabook” in a way that would not be possible on a shared mainframe; millions of potential users meant that the user interface would have to become a learning environment along the lines of Montessori and Bruner; and needs for large scope, reduction in complexity, and end-user literacy would require that data and control structures be done away with in favor of a more biological scheme of protected universal cells interacting only through messages that could mimic any desired behavior.
Early Smalltalk was the first complete realization of these new points of view   as parented by its many predecessors in hardware, language and user interface design. It became the exemplar of the new computing, in part, because we were actually trying for a qualitative shift in belief structures—a new Kuhnian paradigm in the same spirit as the invention of the printing press—and thus took highly extreme positions which almost forced these new styles to be invented.},

The views are defined by a query language that produces a list of documents selected from one or more input sources. The selection conditions involve vertical and horizontal navigation, thus querying explicitly the order present in input documents. We point several strong limitations in the descriptive ability of current {DTDs} and the need for extending them with (i) a subtyping mechanism and (ii) a more powerful specification mechanism than regular languages, such as context-free languages. With these extensions, we show that one can always infer tight {DTDs}, that precisely characterize a selection view on sources satisfying given {DTDs}. We also show important special cases where one can infer a tight {DTD} without requiring extension (ii). Finally we consider related problems such as verifying conformance of a view definition with a predefined {DTD}....},

	abstract = {{META} {II} is a compiler writing language which consists of syntax equations resembling Backus normal form and into which instructions to output assembly language commands are inserted. Compilers have been written in this language for {VALGOL} I and {VALGOL} {II}. The former is a simple algebraic language designed for the purpose of illustrating {META} {II}. The latter contains a fairly large subset of {ALGOL} 60. The method of writing compilers which is given in detail in the paper may be explained briefly as follows. Each syntax equation is translated into a recursive subroutine which tests the input string for a particular phrase structure, and deletes it if found. Backup is avoided by the extensive use of factoring in the syntax equations. For each source language, an interpreter is written and programs are compiled into that interpretive language.},

	abstract = {In computing, an object-oriented user interface ({OOUI}) is a type of user interface based on an object-oriented programming metaphor. In an {OOUI}, the user interacts explicitly with objects that represent entities in the domain that the application is concerned with. Many vector drawing applications, for example, have an {OOUI} – the objects being lines, circles and canvases. The user may explicitly select an object, alter its properties (such as size or colour), or invoke other actions upon it (such as to move, copy, or re-align it). If a business application has any {OOUI}, the user may be selecting and/or invoking actions on objects representing entities in the business domain such as customers, products or orders.
Jakob Nielsen defines the {OOUI} in contrast to function-oriented interfaces: "Object-oriented interfaces are sometimes described as turning the application inside-out as compared to function-oriented interfaces. The main focus of the interaction changes to become the users' data and other information objects that are typically represented graphically on the screen as icons or in windows."
Dave Collins defines an {OOUI} as demonstrating three characteristics:
Users perceive and act on objects
Users can classify objects based on how they behave
In the context of what users are trying to do, all the user interface objects fit together into a coherent overall representation.
Jef Raskin suggests that the most important characteristic of an {OOUI} is that it adopts a 'noun-verb', rather than a 'verb-noun' style of interaction, and that this has several advantages in terms of usability.},

The three cases offer an excellent comparative view of the origin and progress of literacy creation for small indigenous languages in the Russian Federation. The fourth language Skolt Sámi (Uralic) provides a comparative view beyond the border into the European Union. The different geographical and political settings of language planning attempts for the four languages has resulted in chronologically and substantially different developments. For Dolgan, Forest Enets and Kildin Sámi, the effect standardization has upon language survival has been very similar. In these languages, neither standardization nor the evolving written culture seem to inhibit language shift to any considerable degree. On the other hand, Skolt Sámi in Finland has undergone a slightly more successful process of revitalization, even though the language remains critically endangered.},

	abstract = {The Saami languages, a branch of the Uralic language family, are a group of nine rather closely related but mutually mostly unintelligible languages spoken by the indigenous Saami people of Central and Northern Scandinavia, Northern Finland and extreme Northwestern Russia. All of the languages are either endangered, mostly seriously so, or moribund. The study of Saami languages has a very long tradition in the field of Uralic linguistics. Even though the research tradition has been heavily oriented towards historical linguistics, previous generations of scholars have also compiled vast amounts of primary language materials such as audio recordings and texts. In this sense, thus, most Saami languages can be characterized as very well documented. From a descriptive point of view, however, the situation is somewhat different: adequate reference grammars are few, and dictionaries of many languages are in an outdated format, employing a narrow phonetic transcription. Himmelmann (1998) has drawn attention to the distinction between ‘documentary’ and ‘descriptive’ linguistics, emphasizing the importance of extensive primary documentation that can serve a variety of linguistic and other purposes. In contrast, work aiming at the description of less studied languages has often been oriented towards the publication of reference grammars and dictionaries, sometimes altogether skipping the step of archiving and publication of primary linguistic data. In the case of Saami languages the situation is almost a reverse one: there is a huge amount of archived or published primary linguistic material, whereas descriptive work is more limited, or in the case of some languages almost entirely lacking. In my presentation I will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of this data-oriented or ‘documentary’ tradition. In particular, I will examine how the extant materials facilitate grammatical description (e.g., writing of reference grammars) as well as practical efforts at language revitalization. It will be seen that while the existence of extensive linguistic corpora is in many ways beneficial to both endeavors, the situation is nevertheless not as ideal as proponents of a broad ‘documentary’ approach have envisioned.

	abstract = {The increasing importance of language documentation as a paradigm in linguistic research means that many linguists now spend substantial amounts of time preparing digital corpora of language data for long-term access. Benefits of this development include: (i) making analyses accountable to the primary material on which they are based; (ii) providing future researchers with a body of linguistic material to analyse in ways not foreseen by the original collector of the data; and, equally importantly, (iii) acknowledging the responsibility of the linguist to create records that can be accessed by the speakers of the language and by their descendants. Preparing such data collections requires substantial scholarly effort, and in order to make this approach sustainable, those who undertake it need to receive appropriate academic recognition of their effort in relevant institutional contexts. Such recognition is especially important for early-career scholars so that they can devote efforts to the compilation of annotated corpora and to making them accessible without damaging their careers in the long-term by impacting negatively on their publication record. Preliminary discussions between the Australian Linguistic Society ({ALS}) and the Australian Research Council ({ARC}) made it clear that the {ARC} accepts that curated corpora can legitimately be seen as research output, but that it is the responsibility of the {ALS} (and the scholarly community more generally) to establish conventions to accord scholarly credibility to such research products. This paper reports on the activities of the authors in exploring this issue on behalf of the {ALS} and it discusses issues in two areas: (a) what sort of process is appropriate in according acknowledgment and validation to curated corpora as research output; and (b) what are the appropriate criteria against which such validation should be judged? While the discussion focuses on the Australian linguistic context, it is also more broadly applicable as we will present in this article.},

	abstract = {In computer science, a parsing expression grammar, or {PEG}, is a type of analytic formal grammar, i.e. it describes a formal language in terms of a set of rules for recognizing strings in the language. The formalism was introduced by Bryan Ford in 2004 and is closely related to the family of top-down parsing languages introduced in the early 1970s. Syntactically, {PEGs} also look similar to context-free grammars ({CFGs}), but they have a different interpretation: the choice operator selects the first match in {PEG}, while it is ambiguous in {CFG}. This is closer to how string recognition tends to be done in practice, e.g. by a recursive descent parser.
Unlike {CFGs}, {PEGs} cannot be ambiguous; if a string parses, it has exactly one valid parse tree. It is conjectured that there exist context-free languages that cannot be parsed by a {PEG}, but this is not yet proven. {PEGs} are well-suited to parsing computer languages (and artificial human languages such as Lojban), but not natural languages where their performance is comparable to general {CFG} algorithms such as the Earley algorithm.},

Starting from the notion of lexicographic functions as defined by Henning Bergenholtz and Sven Tarp, this question is approached by analysing how current electronic dictionaries and lexical resource models attempt to satisfy the needs of different types of users in different usage situations, in order to identify general requirements on the model for a lexical resource that aims to be “multifunctional” in the above sense. Based on this analysis, this book explores the use of formalisms developed in the context of the semantic web to approach both general and specific lexicographic questions, in particular the representation of multi-word expressions and their properties and relations. In doing so, this book not only addresses several topics which are of relevance to lexicographers and computational linguists alike, but also supports its claims by providing a prototypical implementation of a multifunctional lexical resource using semantic web formalisms.},

This generalization consists primarily in defining a total order over the sequences (often called words in computer science) of elements of a finite totally ordered set, often called alphabet.
There are several variants and generalizations of the lexicographical ordering. One variant widely used in combinatorics orders subsets of a given finite set by assigning a total order to the finite set, and converting subsets into increasing sequences, to which the lexicographical order is applied. Another generalization defines an order on a Cartesian product of partially ordered sets; this order is a total order if and only if the factors of the Cartesian product are totally ordered.},

The inventory of morphophonemes follows directly from this alignment.

The alignment and rules are based upon an approximate general metric among phonemes, e.g., articulatory features, that determines which alternations are likely or possible.

Different approaches have been taken in encouraging heritage learners to use the languages again, but there are points in common, and each has something to learn from the other. The work of the Cornish Language Partnership in organizing and encouraging Cornish learners is compared with the courses run by the branch of the Livonian Association in Kolka, Kurzeme.Kokkuvõte.

	abstract = {This article explores opportunities for expanding the vocabulary of Livonian through compounds, borrowings, derived words, and calques. It is clear that these methods have been effectively used already throughout the entire period of development of the modern Livonian literary language and, therefore, specific traditions have evolved in forming neologisms in Livonian. So, in forming compounds, one has to pay special attention to whether the singular or plural form is used for each component, the historical genitive is used in select types of compounds, or one or both components must be declined. Borrowings in Livonian are largely connected with internationalisms borrowed through Latvian, but adapted to fit with the unique demands of Livonian pronunciation and morphology. Derivation using suffixes is quite productive, while derivation using prefixes is distinctly limited, despite views to the contrary which are sometimes encountered. Many new concepts have actively entered Livonian through the use of calques. Two major groups of calques can be distinguished, which are those formed based on Latvian and those formed based on Estonian. Word formation in Livonian is still a little studied topic where more in depth studies are needed; however, already existing research into the expansion of the Livonian lexicon ensures the existence of a rich source of material for future study in this area.Kokkuvõte. Valts Ernštreits: Liivi keele sõnavara rikastamise meetodid. Artiklis on vaadeldud liivi keele sõnavara rikastamise viise – liitsõnu, laensõnu, tuletisi ja tõlkelaene. On täheldatav, et neid sõnavara laiendamise võimalusi on efektiivselt kasutatud juba kogu tänapäeva liivi kirjakeele kujunemisaja jooksul ning uudissõnade loomisel on liivi keeles kujunenud välja kindlad tavad. Nii tuleb uute liitsõnade loomisel pöörata tähelepanu ainsuse või mitmuse kasutusele sõltuvas osises, samuti liitsõnade eriliikidele, mis sisaldavad ajaloolist genitiivi lõppu või mille mõlemad osised on käänduvad. Laensõnad on liivi keeles peamiselt seotud internatsionalismidega, mille vahendajakeeleks on läti keel, ning laenatud sõnu tuleb kohaldada liivi keele häälduse ja morfoloogia iseärasustele. Väga produktiivsed on liivi keeles tuletised, mis on moodustatud sufiksitega, kuid prefiksite kasutamine on vastupidiselt kohati levinud arvamusele tugevalt piiratud. Paljud uued mõisted tulevad liivi keelde tõlkelaenudena, seejuures saab eristada kaht suuremat tõlkelaenude rühma – eesti ja läti keele malli järgi loodud tõlkelaene. Liivi keele sõnaloome on praeguseni võrdlemisi vähe uuritud teema, mispärast töö tuleb sel alal jätkata. Siiski annab juba tehtud töö keele rikastamisel mitmekülgset näidismaterjali edaspidiseks liivi sõnavara täiendamiseks.Märksõnad: liivi keel, keelekontaktid, sõnavara, sõnaloome, uudissõnad, laensõnad, sõnatuletus, sufiksid, prefiksid, {tõlkelaenudKubbõvõttõks}.

That is, the formal side of morphology has a certain autonomy. The title of Aronoff’s recent book, Morphology by Itself (Aronoff 1994) nicely expresses this idea of the autonomy of morphological form. For instance, the form-meaning relations in inflection may be mediated by inflectional classes (declinational classes for nouns and adjectives, and conjugational classes for verbs). As Aronoff (1994) pointed out, the existence of such classes results in one-to-many relations between morpho-syntactic properties of lexemes and their phonological forms.},

The principles of word structure can be divided roughly between those that govern the distribution of "morphemes " or subconstituents of a word and those that govern the variations in shape shown by these elements; and early developments in phonology and syntax left little if any distinctive content to such a field in either of these two domains. In phonology, the discovery was made that when we extend the scope of rule governed generalizations beyond the particular limits imposed (as in classical phonemic theory) by surface contrast, the effect is to increase the range of cases in which variation in shape shown by a linguistically elementary unit can be reduced to a single underlying form. This observation raised the very real possibility that (with the exception of the facts of lexically governed suppletion, which are comparatively uninteresting from the point of view of linguistic structure) all of the study of "allomorphy " would turn out to},

Erinevates kontekstides võib ühel sõnal olla erinevad semantilised interpretatsioonid, milleks on homonüümia ja polüseemia. Sõnatähenduse ühestamine käib mingi etaloni alusel, milleks on eesti keeles {TEKsaurus}. Tema väikseim osa on sünohulk ehk sünonüümirida, mille moodustavad ühte mõistet väljendavad sünonüümsed (sama tähendusega) sõnad ja sõnaühendid.
Ühestamisel on kasutusel mitmed meetodid, peamiselt kasutatakse reeglipõhiseid ja statistikal põhinevaid ühestajaid. Käesoleva töö teoreetilises osas antakse ülevaade sõnatähenduse ühestamise erinevatest mudelitest ja käsitsi ning automaatse ühestamise meetoditest. Hetkel on eesti keele jaoks olemas umbes 500 000 sõnast koosnev morfoloogiliselt ühestatud korpus, mida on ühestanud vähemalt kaks inimest.
Praktilise osa eesmärgiks oli formaliseerida olemasolevad sõnatähenduste ühestamise reeglid ja luua programm, mis kasutaks neid reegleid sõnatähenduste märgendamiseks korpuses. Töö käigus formaliseeriti 75 nimisõna ja 5 verbi reeglit. Sõnatähenduste ühestamise reeglid olid seni kirja pandud eestikeelsete lausetena, mis olid abiks leksikograafidele õige sõnatähenduse määramisel.},

	abstract = {In computer science, an abstract state machine ({ASM}) is a state machine operating on states which are arbitrary data structures (structure in the sense of mathematical logic, that is a nonempty set together with a number of functions (operations over the set) and relations).
The {ASM} Method is a practical and scientifically well-founded systems engineering method which bridges the gap between the two ends of system development:
the human understanding and formulation of real-world problems (requirements capture by accurate high-level modeling at the level of abstraction determined by the given application domain)
the deployment of their algorithmic solutions by code-executing machines on changing platforms (definition of design decisions, system and implementation details).
The method builds upon three basic concepts:
{ASM}: a precise form of pseudo-code, generalizing Finite State Machines to operate over arbitrary data structures
ground model: a rigorous form of blueprints, serving as authoritative reference model for the design
refinement: a most general scheme for stepwise instantiations of model abstractions to concrete system elements, providing controllable links between the more and more detailed descriptions at the successive stages of system development.
In the original conception of {ASMs}, a single agent executes a program in a sequence of steps, possibly interacting with its environment. This notion was extended to capture distributed computations, in which multiple agents execute their programs concurrently.
Since {ASMs} model algorithms at arbitrary levels of abstraction, they can provide high-level, low-level and mid-level views of a hardware or software design. {ASM} specifications often consist of a series of {ASM} models, starting with an abstract ground model and proceeding to greater levels of detail in successive refinements or coarsenings.
Due to the algorithmic and mathematical nature of these three concepts, {ASM} models and their properties of interest can be analyzed using any rigorous form of verification (by reasoning) or validation (by experimentation, testing model executions).},

	abstract = {Agda is a dependently typed functional programming language originally developed by Ulf Norell at Chalmers University of Technology with implementation described in his {PhD} thesis. The current version of Agda was originally known as Agda 2. The original Agda system was developed at Chalmers by Catarina Coquand in 1999. The current version is a full rewrite, which should be considered a new language that shares a name and tradition.
Agda, unlike Coq, has no support for tactics, and proofs are written in a functional programming style. The language has ordinary programming constructs such as data types, pattern matching, records, let expressions and modules, and a Haskell-like syntax. The system has an Emacs interface but can also be run in batch mode from the command line.
Agda is based on Zhaohui Luo's Unified Theory of Dependent Types ({UTT}) a type theory similar to Martin-Löf type theory.},

	abstract = {Formal Semantics and Distributional Semantics are two very influential semantic frameworks in Computational Linguistics. Formal Semantics is based on a symbolic tradition and centered around the inferential properties of language. Distributional Semantics is statistical and data-driven, and focuses on aspects of meaning related to descriptive content. The two frameworks are complementary in their strengths, and this has motivated interest in combining them into an overarching semantic framework: a “Formal Distributional Semantics.” Given the fundamentally different natures of the two paradigms, however, building an integrative framework poses significant theoretical and engineering challenges. The present issue of Computational Linguistics advances the state of the art in Formal Distributional Semantics; this introductory article explains the motivation behind it and summarizes the contributions of previous work on the topic, providing the necessary background for the articles that follow.},

First, we outline a formal semantic theory that aims to combine the virtues of both formal and distributional frameworks. We then proceed to develop an algebraic interpretation of that formal semantic theory and show how at least two kinds of distributional models make this interpretation concrete. Focusing on the case of adjective–noun composition, we compare several distributional models with respect to the semantic information that a formal semantic theory would need, and we show how to integrate the information provided by distributional models back into the formal semantic framework.},

It covers the pioneering era of the field, from the semaphores of the mid 1960s to the remote procedure calls of the late 1970s."The Origin of Concurrent Programming" presents 19 seminal papers by E. W. Dijkstra, P. Brinch Hansen, and C. A. R. Hoare. While focusing on contributions of major and lasting importance, the book:  * Features an essay that summarizes the papers and puts them in historical perspective.  * Builds on fundamental programming concepts, such as speed independence, fair scheduling, mutual exclusion, deadlock prevention, and process communication.  * Covers the invention of programming notation for semaphores, conditional critical regions, monitors, synchronous message communication, and remote procedure calls. * Captures the historic contribution of concurrent programming to our understanding of operating system principles.  * Illustrates the use of semaphores, message buffers, and monitors in the systematic design of operating systems.  * Describes secure programming languages based on monitors and synchronous message communication.  * Includes a bibliography of 160 papers and books on concurrent programming. Edited by a computer pioneer, "The Origin of Concurrent Programming" is an essential reader on the historic development of concurrent programming. It is an invaluable resource for students, researchers and professionals who are familiar with operating system principles.},

Using {EXI} format reduces the verbosity of {XML} documents as well as the cost of parsing. Improvements in the performance of writing (generating) content depends on the speed of the medium being written to, the methods and quality of actual implementations. {EXI} is useful for
a complete range of {XML} document sizes, from dozens of bytes to terabytes
reducing computational overhead to speed up parsing of compressed documents
increasing endurance of small devices by utilizing efficient decompression},

The word inflection can be considered as a classification problem, where the class label denotes the corresponding transformation rule. The main benefit of the proposed method is the efficient generalization feature. The proposed morpheme analyzer module was implemented in a prototype question generation application.},

The salience index of the ideal most salient term has the figure 1 and that of the term not mentioned at all the value is 0.

As such, it provides insight into languagepolicies, the ethnolinguistic vitality and the struggle for reversal of language shift, language revitalization and empowerment of minorities in Russia and the European Union. The volume shows that, even though largely unknown to a broader English-reading audience, the linguistic composition of Russia is by no means less diverse than multilingualism in the {EU}. It is therefore a valuable introduction into the historical backgrounds and current linguistic, social and legal affairs with regard to Russia's manifold ethnic and linguistic minorities, mirrored on the discussion of recent issues in a number ofwell-known Western European minority situations},

patterns within standard {LMF}. The use of standard {LMF} for representing the paradigm patterns is argued to be valuable for linguistic documentation and useful in the creation of a morphological lexicon for the Votic language. The workflow can also be seen as a motivator for community driven language documentation using low-tech and human friendly platforms such as the Wiktionary.},

	shorttitle = {Linguistic Aesthetics from the Nineteenth to the Twentieth Century},
	abstract = {From the early nineteenth century up until the first half of the twentieth century, many leading scholars in the emerging field of linguistics were occupied with what would today be considered a kind of linguistic typology. The various classifications of languages they proposed were generally intertwined with speculation about the “racial” traits or national mentalities that different language types might represent and their putative value relative to one another. This article investigates these schemes from the perspective of Otto Jespersen’s (1860–1943) theory of “progress in language.” It first shows how Jespersen, inspired by theoretical developments in linguistics and neighboring sciences, inverted the traditional rankings and praised the modern “analytic” European languages over their classical “synthetic” ancestors. It then explores contemporary reactions to Jespersen’s theory and traces the gradual disappearance of language evaluation and related questions from the discipline. Charles Bally (1865–1947) receives special attention for his nuanced critique of Jespersen’s position, which casts unique light on linguistic ideology in the period that saw the birth of structuralism in its different varieties.},

The two main components of this infrastructure deal with text corpora and with lexical resources. For modularity and flexibility, both components have a backend, or server-side part, accessed through an {API} made up of a set of well-defined web services. This means that there can be any number of different user interfaces to these components, corresponding, e.g., to different research needs. Here, we will demonstrate the standard corpus and lexicon search interfaces, designed primarily for linguistic searches: Korp and Karp.},

	abstract = {An introduction to dependent types, demonstrating the most beautiful aspects, one step at a time.A program's type describes its behavior. Dependent types are a first-class part of a language, and are much more powerful than other kinds of types; using just one language for types and programs allows program descriptions to be as powerful as the programs they describe. The Little Typer explains dependent types, beginning with a very small language that looks very much like Scheme and extending it to cover both programming with dependent types and using dependent types for mathematical reasoning. Readers should be familiar with the basics of a Lisp-like programming language, as presented in the first four chapters of The Little Schemer. The first five chapters of The Little Typer provide the needed tools to understand dependent types; the remaining chapters use these tools to build a bridge between mathematics and programming. Readers will learn that tools they know from programming―pairs, lists, functions, and recursion―can also capture patterns of reasoning. The Little Typer does not attempt to teach either practical programming skills or a fully rigorous approach to types. Instead, it demonstrates the most beautiful aspects as simply as possible, one step at a time.},

	abstract = {Väitekiri „Liivi kirjakeele kujunemine“ jälgib liivi kirjakeele arenemist alates esimeste liivikeelsete raamatute ilmumisest kuni viimaste katkematut kirjakeele traditsiooni jätkanud liivikeelsete allikateni. Ajaliselt hõlmab see ajavahemikku alates 1863. aastast kuni aastani 1982. Liivi kirjakeele arengu kajastamisel lähtub uurimus kahest aspektist. Esimeseks on kirjakeele ja selle allikate kujunemislugu – ajalooline taust, allikate valmimise käigus osalenud isikud ja erinevad allikate väljaandmisega seotud asjaolud. Teiseks aspektiks on allikates kasutatud keeleliste iseärasuste väljaselgitamine ja kõrvutamine eesmärgiga saada ülevaade liivi kirjakeele arendamisel toimunud üldisest arengust ja kasutatud põhimõtetest, milleks on kasutatud 23 liivi kirjakeelega seotud fonoloogia-, morfoloogia- ja leksikaalast tunnusjoont. Kokku on vaadeldud 29 allikat, sh 19 trükist, 2 perioodilist väljaannet, 6 käsikirja ja 2 tundmatut käsikirja, mille olemasolu kohta on andmeid, kuid mida ei ole seni õnnestunud tuvastada. Samuti sisaldab uurimus kokkuvõtte varasematest liivi kirjakeele alal tehtud ja liivi kirjakeele allikaid uurimismaterjalina kasutanud uurimustest ja pärast 1982. aastat ilmunud kirjakeelsetest väljaannetest. Uurimus annab üksikasjaliku ülevaate iga selles vaadeldud liivi kirjakeele allika kujunemisloost ja selles kasutatud keelelistest põhimõtetest, lisaks esitab see ka kirjakeele üldist arengut iseloomustava koondkokkuvõte kõikide uurimuses vaadeldud tunnuste lõikes.},

	abstract = {Eesti keele sõnavara on oma päritolult väga mitmekesine ning selle uurimisel on pikaaegne traditsioon. Väitekirja eesmärk on selgitada, millised on eesti keele kultuursõnavara, sealhulgas vaimuliku kultuuri sõnavara kujunemise peamised tegurid, kuidas mõistete ja neile vastavate terminite kujunemist eesti keeles on mõjutanud kontaktid teiste keeltega ning millist rolli mängib selles eestlaste asuala ajalooline paiknemine mitme kultuurilise (õigeusu, katoliikluse, luterluse), keelelise (soome-ugri ja indo-euroopa) ja poliitilise (Venemaa, Saksa ordu, Rootsi jt) regiooni piirialal.  Ühtlasi püütakse täpsustada eesti tüvevara päritolukihte ja nende mahtu tänapäeva teadmiste seisukohalt, võttes aluseks 2012. aastal ilmunud “Eesti etümoloogiasõnaraamatus” sisalduvat materjali. Uurimuses tehakse järeldus, et eesti keele sõnavara ja mõistesüsteemi on seni arvatust tugevamini mõjutanud ja kujundanud välised tegurid, mis ilmneb selles, et laentüvede osakaal eesti tüvevaras on suurem, kui varem arvatud, ning asjaolus, et kontaktkeeled on mõjutanud eesti sõnavara kujunemist suurel määral nii tõlkelaenude kui sõnamoodustuse vallas. Eesti sõnavara päritolu uurimisel on seejuures kombineeritud erinevaid meetodeid, sealhulgas võrdlev-ajaloolist meetodit, tähendusväljadel tuginevat semasioloogilist lähenemist ja vana kirjakeele tekstikriitilist analüüsi.
Väitekirja põhiosa moodustavates artiklites võetakse ühelt poolt vaatluse alla üksikute eesti kirjakeele sõnade etümoloogia, kusjuures vaadeldavatest sõnadest kuuluvad armastus, põrgu, päästma ja ristima vaimuliku kultuuri sõnavara hulka ning krunn materiaalse kultuuri sõnavara hulka, ning teiselt poolt analüüsitakse eesti tüvevara etümoloogilist koostist tervikuna.},
