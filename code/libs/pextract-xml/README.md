# Pextract XML API

This is a XQuery module for viewing and manipulating [pextract](https://github.com/marfors/paradigmextract) paradigm files
as if they were xml files. It is used mainly in bootstrapping morphology 
resource building in the Grammatical Framework using the [pextract2GF](https://github.com/keeleleek/pextract2gf) tool.

The library is also used for representing the extracted paradigm data as 
paradigm patterns within the Lexical Markup Framework and it's intentional 
morphology module.

This work depends on the [pextract](https://github.com/marfors/paradigmextract) 
tool and the [DFDL schema](https://github.com/keeleleek/dfdl-pextract-schema) 
for converting the textual paradigm files to an appropriate XML.
